The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Surprising insight: why popular models underperform for our task\"\n- Current start time: 29.44 seconds\n- Current end time: 70.00 seconds\n\nIMPORTANT - COORDINATE SYSTEM:\nAll timestamps (transcript, video, and the current moment times above) are in the SAME normalized coordinate system:\n- The clip starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The clip ends at 100.24 seconds\n- Both the transcript and video are aligned to this coordinate system\n- Your output timestamps must also be in this coordinate system (0.00 to 100.24)\n\nThe current timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nNone\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps.
