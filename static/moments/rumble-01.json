segments:\n[175.60] Welcome to the Rumble lineup live.\n[178.16] That's every weekday, 9 a.m.\n[180.48] Eastern through 7 p.m.\n[182.40] You don't need to change that dial.\n[183.76] Again, some of you are unfamiliar with Adal, kind of like manual windows.\n[187.36] We realized that after yesterday's sketch, but I think you get it in principle.\n[191.12] Welcome uh viewers coming in from Vince.\n[193.12] Uh of course, Bon Gino Army.\n[194.80] We're glad to have you here.\n[195.52] I know that Bonino has some assistance over there at the uh the old FBI, which reminds me.\n[200.40] Is James Comey okay?\n[202.40] I mean, I know he's a cross dresser, tell everybody, but I don't know if he's okay when you see his latest video.\n[207.68] We're gonna talk about that today.\n[208.64] He's a swifty.\n[212.48] He's a swifty, and s and old Swift inspired him to stand up against Trump.\n[217.04] And by stand up against Trump, I mean lie about Donald Trump and try and destroy his career, his credibility, and his livelihood.\n[222.48] So we're gonna talk about that.\n[223.44] It's no small thing.\n[224.56] Chris Pratt was on with Bill Maher.\n[226.72] Um I like Chris Pratt.\n[229.76] There was a uh a black leftist.\n[233.36] Picture her in your head.\n[234.48] Yep.\n[236.08] On Jubilee, I think it's what is it called?\n[238.16] Uh surrounded with 20 black conservatives.\n[240.40] That's fun, and it shows you everything wrong with black liberalism today.\n[243.04] And hey, is there headway to be made?\n[244.40] That's my question to you.\n[245.68] Remember the black sit sort of uh or sorry, Blex it never really materialized.\n[249.68] And we saw a huge shift in Latino votes, Hispanic votes, where younger Hispanic men are now actually voting uh as a majority Republican block.\n[257.84] Do you see that oscillation that's never really shifted with the black American vote ever going Republican?\n[263.12] And I don't mean in social media world, I mean in the real world.\n[265.28] Then of course, most important President Trump uh had his meeting with Zelensky, and um the left wants us to fail, and by that, I mean they want more war.\n[276.00] Either you want President Trump to succeed, and he is right now.\n[278.80] We're making a lot of headway here, which is good for Americans, or you want him to fail, in which case you want perpetual war.\n[285.36] By the way, the next commercial you're about to see, it's a new sponsor.\n[288.24] There's a lot of legal stuff that had to be included at the end.\n[291.04] So we'll see.\n[293.20] Yeah, I thought that was a kid's pool toys, the squeakers.\n[299.44] Sound I'll never forget.\n[306.72] Oh, hey, scene is Would you just would you just drive up it?\n[311.60] I'm a Claren.\n[313.52] That's like a 200,000 dollar car.\n[316.16] But that one out there.\n[317.20] Well.\n[320.56] It's a $50,000 Rolex, Billy.\n[322.88] Yeah, I guess it is, yeah.\n[324.40] New suit.\n[325.52] Yeah, it's great, isn't it?\n[327.84] Weren't you and I just having a conversation last week about your credit score being shot?\n[333.36] Was that last week?\n[334.56] Last week.\n[335.52] Oh.\n[338.24] No, it's not anybody's guess.\n[340.16] This is what it is, Billy.\n[342.24] 200,000 car, a $50,000 watch, and I remani's suit.\n[347.44] It's a mystery.\n[348.40] No, there's no mystery.\n[349.44] Your credit score is shot because of these completely unnecessary lavish purchases.\n[354.64] Oh.\n[355.52] Download the the kickoff app.\n[357.20] We talked about it.\n[357.92] They they help build your credit fast.\n[360.72] If you do that, I don't know if they'll help you with this, but give it a sharp house.\n[366.72] Killer suit, though, right?\n[369.52] Stop.\n[371.44] Billy, what's going on with your butt?\n[373.76] What's going on with your butt?\n[375.92] This is the way God made me.\n[377.36] This great, right?\n[382.96] Yeah.\n[383.92] How much was that?\n[385.84] Twelve thousand dollars.\n[393.12] Yeah, I guess.\n[394.72] Check it out.\n[400.24] Users for credit under 600 ruin average of 84 points in their first year with on-time payments.\n[403.44] With transparent affordable plan starting at just five dollars a month, no hidden fee, zero interest.\n[406.08] Kickoff helps you score big when it comes to credit.\n[407.44] It's simple.\n[407.76] You make on time payments, credit bureau, see good behavior, and your credit can grow fast.\n[409.92] Start building credit with kickoff for as well as one dollar.\n[411.92] That's eight percent normal price.\n[412.80] When you go to get kick off.com slash crowder today.\n[414.40] That's kick off with the get kick off.com slash crowd.\n[464.24] Yeah, I bet you'll get a call, Gerald.\n[467.60] Here's the thing I will say.\n[469.04] I will say this kickoff, and it's one of the few products I wearing a couple of things.\n[472.00] It's one of the few products that I don't use because I have stellar credit.\n[475.20] But uh it's really useful and it works, but there's so much stuff that needs to be included.\n[479.28] We were like, do we re uh okay, all right, but I do recommend it.\n[482.24] If you have if you have credit, that's bad.\n[484.00] Hey, it'll help you.\n[484.96] I just I don't know how long this I don't know how long the sponsorship's gonna last.\n[488.72] I need a shirt, guys.\n[489.60] I got so screwed up by all this, I kept my normal shirt on.\n[493.44] All right.\n[494.32] Uh and let me ask you this also another Donald Duck.\n[498.00] What?\n[498.48] Oh yeah.\n[507.28] Still one of the hardest uh times I've ever left in my life was you voicing Donald Trump Donald Duck being raped.\n[515.28] By the way, I don't say that to be profane, that's an actual thing that Doug do.\n[518.24] They do it to establish a pecking order.\n[520.72] Established!\n[523.60] Oh yeah, I got a lake in front of my house, dude.\n[525.52] It's sex city out there.\n[526.64] Dude, there are not people think it's orgy town.\n[529.76] What was Toolman?\n[530.56] You just went to color bars?\n[531.52] What was that?\n[532.00] Yeah, that was uh I thought it was kind of cool.\n[533.68] Wrong.\n[534.16] Alright.\n[534.64] Can you admonish yourself?\n[536.08] Hey, the good news is you can tune in to this level of quality every weekday, 11 a.m.\n[539.36] Eastern.\n[540.08] Captain Morgan, CEO, I know you're well.\n[541.92] Friday and Saturday, August 22nd and 23rd in Portland, Oregon, Helium Comedy Club.\n[546.96] Uh Josh Eerstein looking uh looking very 90s-ish with the hair product down the middle, but it'll make sense.\n[552.08] I don't know.\n[555.68] Too late, bad.\n[556.32] It's this weekend, by the way, in Portland.\n[557.84] Yeah.\n[558.32] Yeah.\n[558.64] Yeah.\n[559.04] I thought you were saying it was this week in like a Dawson's Creek reunion.\n[562.08] That's also happening in Portland.\n[563.36] We're gonna burn down a precinct that's gonna be great.\n[565.12] I liked Pacey.\n[566.00] I love how by the way, one of the assistants just brought in another shirt for Gerald.\n[570.08] Because he's so I thought she was gonna I thought she's gonna come in.\n[575.44] I thought she was gonna come in and be like, uh, kickoff has kicked us off.\n[578.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[580.16] All right.\n[580.88] Uh while Gerald was getting changed.\n[583.04] By the way, nice traps.\n[584.64] Yeah, good traps on that guy.\n[586.64] Hair all over him.\n[587.36] It's a stuff of children's nightmares.\n[588.96] So let me ask you this before I move on.\n[591.04] Uh hey, uh, you know all cultures are equal.\n[593.92] Mm-hmm.\n[594.72] Hell.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[599.28] Ping.\n[590.16] This before I move on.\n[591.52] Hey, uh, you know, all cultures are equal.\n[594.72] Oh.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[600.16] Cow dung.\n[601.12] Can't be a luxury skincare.\n[602.88] Think again.\n[603.76] This is cowpeti's lavender and fun seed soap, a patented formula.\n[608.40] That is a pure genius.\n[610.08] Made from dry, beautified cow dung from indigenous cow blended with living.\n[614.72] Beautiful seeds and uh gotta be in indigenous cow dung.\n[619.44] DP hybrids and even helps heal skin issues like eczema wounds and mood.\n[624.88] It forms a legend.\n[626.56] Smells amazing from the start to finish, and outlaws so it says no paravents, no sulfates, no toxins, just clean seats gear.\n[637.20] Speak from nature.\n[638.32] Copetti wellness through mother go.\n[641.20] A couple of things that really are upsetting with that.\n[643.20] Number one is that someone will actually look at that and go, oh no, parabens.\n[646.56] That's good.\n[646.96] Yeah, you should be more concerned with the cow shit.\n[649.60] That's true.\n[650.24] I like that it's it says cowpathy, but she pronounces it cowpatty.\n[653.92] Yeah, exactly.\n[654.72] Yeah, I think that's very accurate.\n[656.16] She says outlast soap, but it sounds like outlaw soap.\n[660.24] This shower ain't big enough for the two of us.\n[663.28] And uh also when we say all cultures are equal, because here's the thing.\n[667.12] People will excuse this and go, oh, you know, yeah, cow dog.\n[669.36] First off, there's no there's no evidence that uh it will do anything other than make you smell like cowdung.\n[673.28] Second, you can't make those claims.\n[675.28] You understand that in the United States?\n[676.80] Like you can't, it will cure eczema, and it was starting the age.\n[680.32] Like she just says stuff.\n[681.76] And you can't say in the United States, you have to prove.\n[684.48] And I get it, we have a problem with the FDA, and there's a lot of red tape.\n[687.92] But for people out there who say all cultures are equal.\n[690.24] Do you also think that uh cultures are equal if only some cultures are allowed to make completely unsubstantiated medical claims?\n[696.88] What if someone out there with eczema thinks they're going to fix it with cow crap?\n[701.44] Is this why the trend of bleaching your skin is getting so big in India?\n[705.20] They're putting cow dung all over themselves, and they're like, oh, we gotta bleach that off.\n[708.40] That would make sense.\n[709.52] I like when they finally use soap, it has cow shit in it.\n[712.88] Yes, exactly.\n[714.96] So you can smell the way you want to.\n[716.88] That's right.\n[717.36] That's right.\n[717.84] Look!\n[719.28] Oh boy.\n[721.68] I just don't think that all cultures are equal.\n[723.76] And by that I mean some are bad and they'll remain bad, but it's a new trend.\n[727.76] This is a new trend, selling other cultures to the United States because it's novel, and it's not, or I should say India is not the only culture getting in on the action.\n[736.88] Hey, do you think that bird can't be a healthy hecka product?\n[741.92] Think again.\n[743.60] This is caca de pajaro.\n[745.76] It's made with the finest avocados, cilantro, and bird.\n[750.80] It's a sustainably sourced two in one shampoo and conditioner that will leave your hair feeling silky and smooth.\n[760.16] You look like a million pesos.\n[765.04] That's good luck.\n[766.40] Although he's basically saying you'll look like four dollar.\n[770.24] It's like it's like a thousand bucks.\n[772.64] It sounds impressive.\n[773.68] I don't think so.\n[774.48] Yeah, it is.\n[777.28] I'm gonna guess.\n[777.92] I'm gonna guess 1100.\n[779.04] Hey, great.\n[779.84] What is it?\n[780.40] All right.\n[783.84] 10 grand.\n[784.40] Because I'm American, and this place is better.\n[786.40] Yes, what's the number?\n[787.92] 53,189.\n[790.00] Whoa!\n[791.04] Coming up.\n[791.68] That's the new pay soon.\n[792.88] Hey, bro, you look like 53,489 dollars.\n[797.28] 93 cents.\n[798.16] Don't forget that, bro.\n[799.12] And bro, I round it up.\n[801.28] So get kick off.\n[804.32] Yeah.\n[807.68] Uh I'll tell you who needs to get kicked off the globe.\n[810.80] James Comey.\n[811.68] Well, that's impossible.\n[813.44] And I I this is it's it's funny, it's cringe inducing, and I warn you, this is like over a minute, and it's been cut down from six minutes.\n[822.24] But I remember I've told you this in the past where the left, they just they overuse the term gaslighting.\n[827.04] And the reason they use that is because that's what they do.\n[829.04] So James Comey, first off, he's a Swifty.\n[832.16] Okay.\n[832.48] And he talks about how being a Swifty uh allowed him to stand up to bullies like Donald Trump and gave him the strength.\n[838.64] Here's the thing.\n[839.44] We now know beyond any shadow of a doubt that there was spying on the Trump campaign, right?\n[844.16] That the Russia collusion hoax is just that a hoax.\n[846.96] It was fabricated and it was leaked to the media.\n[848.96] We we we know all of these things.\n[851.44] And he complains and talks about how Donald Trump was the only man who would come after me, and Donald Trump was the only man who I felt the need to record convert because I didn't trust.\n[859.76] What in reality he was part of a fabricated campaign to destroy a man's reputation, his ability to make a living, his family, his legacy.\n[871.12] And I would imagine that President Trump was probably aggressive and aggravated.\n[875.12] Hey, if you were in your workplace and there was an employee who was falsifying emails, pictures to try and get you fired, and to try sending them to your wife.\n[886.40] You were cheating on her, and you knew that it wasn't true, but people were believing it.\n[890.08] Everyone was.\n[890.80] Do you think he'd maybe be mad?\n[892.48] And do you think he'd maybe be a little aggressive with that guy?\n[895.20] And then would that man, James Comey, and this example in this example, would he be entitled to feign outrage and claim victim status?\n[904.24] That's what James Comey has done.\n[906.48] And that's why I believe that James Comey should face serious charges and jail time for his crimes.\n[912.32] But that's not what we're discussing today.\n[913.76] More important is that he's a Swifty, and he's been a fan of her since he was a fully grown man and she was 14.\n[919.60] Donald Trump is still president and still humiliating America on a national stage standing next to Vladimir Putin.\n[926.00] It's like a dream, a bad dream you can't wake up from.\n[929.76] But I don't want to talk about that bad dream this week.\n[931.92] I want to talk about a truly inspirational public figure named Taylor Swift.\n[935.52] This is a hostage.\n[936.56] Taylor Swift, and I go way back.\n[938.88] I went to my first concert of hers 15 years ago.\n[941.76] It was creepy then.\n[942.64] I've been to a second, and I have helped financially support the attendance of a lot of family members at others.\n[949.12] I'm in a family's Swifty group chat.\n[951.76] That's so sad.\n[952.64] I know all her music, and I listened to it in my headphones when I cut the grass.\n[958.88] Although honestly, for me, it's a tie between all too well, 10-minute version and exile, featuring Bonnie Vare.\n[965.92] At every stage of her career, she's shown a certain way of being that resonated with my kids.\n[971.44] Patya Lynn to me as a parent.\n[974.24] And she's still doing that as a grown-up.\n[977.92] Like a lot of you, I struggle with how to stand up to bullies without letting their meanness infect me and change me.\n[990.08] There are far more decent, honest, kind people in America than there are mean jerks.\n[996.56] And don't get me wrong.\n[997.76] We have our jerks, millions of them.\n[999.68] You can have noticed.\n[1000.80] Of course, we need to stand up to jerks and defend what matters.\n[1004.80] But I think we have to try to do that when you're like them.\n[1009.28] Which is what makes me think about Taylor Swift.\n[1012.56] She's made clear that she sees Donald Trump for what he is.\n[1015.92] And last year she urged Americans not to make the serious mistake of electing him.\n[1021.60] Of course, we're now living with the consequences of that mistake, but we know you were involved in a home.\n[1033.44] What's she doing?\n[1035.20] Living her best life.\n[1037.04] Producing great music and as she urged all of us to do during the podcast.\n[1042.00] Why?\n[1042.64] Not giving the jerks power over her mind.\n[1045.36] At my second Taylor Swift concert in Hartford tonight.\n[1050.96] She sang a song about it.\n[1052.80] Why does this exist?\n[1056.40] Why you gotta be so mean?\n[1057.76] And she spoke directly to the nasty people.\n[1060.08] Thank you, Taylor Swift.\n[1062.00] Keep the faith.\n[1063.28] I'm sure she'll take your advice to heart.\n[1066.40] First off, the lack of this reminds me of the you know of office space, Michael Bolton.\n[1071.28] Yeah.\n[1072.24] I celebrate his entire catalog.\n[1074.16] Like it's a joke, and he doesn't realize that it's a joke.\n[1076.16] Also, what you just saw is the problem of feminism personified.\n[1080.56] What do I mean?\n[1081.44] I mean valuing the wrong things.\n[1083.28] I mean valuing nice.\n[1084.48] Hey, Hitler was nice to kids.\n[1085.76] Osama bin Laden was nice to kids.\n[1087.60] You have plenty of horrible people who are nice.\n[1089.36] It's their actions that define them.\n[1091.84] Comey believes he's nice.\n[1093.28] Comey is underhanded, dishonest, and a man of no integrity.\n[1097.20] Who would you rather deal with?\n[1098.16] Someone who's rough around the edges, someone who sends out mean tweets, someone who tells you things that you don't like to hear, but you can count on to be the same person, or somebody who can't be relied upon to pick up your children from school, even if he gives you his word, but he does it with a smile.\n[1114.88] Feminism says nice matters.\n[1117.20] Patriarchy masculinity says that integrity, reliability, dependability, and discipline matters.\n[1125.12] If I have to pick, and Donald Trump is a very flawed man.\n[1127.52] If I have to pick a Donald Trump, or by the way, anyone like uh George Washington or a Jefferson or a Teddy Roosevelt over a Comey or Barack Obama type, I'm going with the strong man who may be a little tougher to deal with every single time.\n[1144.16] Yeah, you know who wasn't nice?\n[1145.36] Winston Churchill.\n[1146.48] That's why he was voted out only a couple years after he helped fight off the axis of evil.\n[1150.00] You know why?\n[1150.40] Because he wasn't nice enough to want socialized health care.\n[1153.92] So it's not a small thing.\n[1155.12] That is feminism personified.\n[1156.96] That is a weak, weak man, and weak men lie, and weak men are untrustworthy.\n[1163.12] And you know who loves weak men?\n[1165.20] Taylor Swift.\n[1166.48] It's clear as day.\n[1167.44] This isn't anything new, by the way.\n[1169.52] So I I don't want to be too harsh on him.\n[1171.44] Plenty of intelligence officials have taken uh cues and great influence from the pop stars of their time.\n[1177.12] Uh who can forget J.\n[1178.00] Edgar Hoover professing his undying love for share.\n[1181.04] Do you believe and of course there was the poorly received Joseph.\n[1180.24] Share.\n[1187.60] And of course, there was the poorly received Joseph McCarthy Ziggy Stardust era.\n[1192.56] This is God.\n[1197.92] And some were a swing and a miss.\n[1200.00] Who can forget the big flop with uh, of course, the head over there, Christopher.\n[1204.88] Uh baby, I was born this Ray.\n[1209.44] Rama Rama.\n[1211.36] The point is gay.\n[1214.32] All right.\n[1216.24] Uh.\n[1217.28] Hey, you know what?\n[1218.48] Uh, you could be a pastor somewhere with that effeminate kind of male thing going on.\n[1224.16] That's I I hate seeing that.\n[1226.16] Listen, it doesn't mean you have to, you know, be some guy that goes out and crushes beers on your skull or something like that.\n[1231.36] No, of course not.\n[1232.40] That's what I'm saying.\n[1233.84] Complaining about bullying when you're the head of the FBI at one point.\n[1237.12] Yeah.\n[1237.52] For four years, you were the head of the FBI and you're complaining about bullying?\n[1240.96] Here's the thing, too.\n[1241.60] That's that's a weird thing.\n[1243.04] It's really easy for them to act nice.\n[1244.48] Right, think about it.\n[1245.12] Everyone thought that Barack Obama was per hey, he's the kind of guy you want to have a beer with.\n[1248.40] By the way, best way to follow me is download the Rumble app, follow me there.\n[1251.28] You'll get this show where live weekdays at 11 a.m.\n[1253.36] Eastern.\n[1253.76] Don't be tied to an algorithm on social media.\n[1256.72] Think about this.\n[1257.36] He accuses Donald Trump of bullying.\n[1259.12] Donald Trump was a, no, wealthy?\n[1261.44] Sure.\n[1261.92] But we all know that wealth doesn't necessarily get you into office, right?\n[1265.04] As seen by spending more money than ever, the uh Kamala Harris campaign.\n[1270.00] Grey Ray, Christopher Ray, Barack Obama, and of course you can sort of add in Hillary Clinton.\n[1275.44] They all took part in a concerted campaign to spy on, destroy the reputation of and leak false information against one man who they didn't like.\n[1286.64] Can you think of any more clear example of bullying than that?\n[1290.24] Right.\n[1290.72] But because Donald Trump said, go screw yourself or whatever.\n[1294.16] We're supposed to believe he's the bully.\n[1295.76] The most powerful people on earth tried to secure their positions of power by as a gang bullying an individual they didn't like who, by the way, was supported by the American public.\n[1308.16] And just to be clear, and I know Ray, the timeline, he's he's gone after that.\n[1312.56] But after Donald Trump did win, they still trumped up a fabricated campaign to delegitimize him, knowing that it was false.\n[1323.28] They were bullying you.\n[1325.04] These people in position when people say it's a big club and you're not in it, they're talking about the Rays, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bidens.\n[1332.00] You understand that they're not talking about the Trumps.\n[1334.00] They're not talking about a real estate agent from New York.\n[1336.48] I can't think of a worse bully and a bully more corrosive to the American fabric.\n[1341.36] You want to know why you don't trust your institutions?\n[1343.36] The left wants to blame you when they want to create a department of misinformation.\n[1346.24] It's Christopher Ray.\n[1348.56] It's Comey.\n[1350.48] That's why you don't trust your institutions.\n[1352.56] And you shouldn't.\n[1354.32] Someone who probably understands where you're coming from.\n[1356.32] Chris Pratt was on Bill Mars uh show.\n[1359.52] Um not the HBO one that people watch, but the one that is entirely uh guest dependent.\n[1365.44] And it's true.\n[1367.92] I will say this.\n[1368.56] You can criticize Chris Pratt there because we all know that he's a uh a a Christian, and I would tend to guess that he leans more conservative, moderate, though he hasn't been super clear about that, but he's very clear about his faith.\n[1379.68] You could uh criticize him for being a fence sitter if you watch the clips, I think in full context, maybe maybe not.\n[1387.04] You could criticize him for being a little milk toast, maybe, but that's not why the left criticizes criticizes him on uh on his appearance on Bill Maher.\n[1396.32] They watched what you're about to watch, and people on the left believe that Chris Pratt is literally Hitler.\n[1402.16] Let's see.\n[1403.04] And in politics, you you inherit enemies.\n[1405.04] And when you jump on in in on, you know, the bandwagon with who is you know the most divisive president ever.\n[1413.12] It makes sense that you're going to be uh made to look terrible.\n[1420.08] And so I don't know what to believe.\n[1421.68] Because I it's not like I sit with Bobby and I go, so hey, let's talk about this.\n[1424.96] Let's talk about it.\n[1425.52] It's like we're just playing cards or playing mafia or having fun or having dinner.\n[1428.48] I'm not gonna pick his brain to find out exactly which of those things are true.\n[1431.04] I just kind of assume that none of them are.\n[1433.12] And for the most part, I wish him well, man.\n[1435.44] I hope that's kind of things that he uh oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way, like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food.\n[1445.04] I think that's a great thing.\n[1446.48] And so just if you just do that, that's amazing.\n[1449.60] I I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be have an allergic reaction to.\n[1457.36] To be like, oh, well, if they do it, I don't want it to happen.\n[1460.32] Um I'll feed my I'll put Clorox in my children's cereal myself.\n[1465.68] Come on, have some be reasonable here.\n[1467.52] There's certain things that would be a good thing to have.\n[1469.04] Uh I want them all to be successful.\n[1471.52] So you may say, like, ah, you know, hey, you could take that a little bit further, Mr.\n[1475.44] Pratt.\n[1476.00] No, I'm not saying that because that's not his job.\n[1478.08] He's an actor.\n[1478.88] Yeah.\n[1480.00] But the left is saying that was that was far enough.\n[1483.36] Did you hear what he said?\n[1484.40] That brings us to Reddit Retards.\n[1491.92] Bang him.\n[1493.28] And just in case you say I'm taking it out of contact.\n[1495.12] Go watch the entire interview.\n[1496.24] It's very similar to that in in tone.\n[1498.32] I would like it if Bill Marr let his guests speak a little more, but that's neither here nor there.\n[1501.60] Well, he was high, so we didn't know.\n[1503.28] So on Reddit, the responses to what you just saw.\n[1505.84] Best animator 182.\n[1508.08] The hatred is extremely reasonable, and Chris Rat.\n[1512.00] I like how they changed the name there.\n[1513.68] Is an idiot.\n[1514.72] There is nothing admirable about policies rooted in eugenics.\n[1520.24] Mentally retarded.\n[1522.00] Well, also no animations there.\n[1524.00] Uh kind of a fake name.\n[1525.84] Yeah.\n[1526.64] Yeah.\n[1526.96] Also, um, I think you might want to do a little bit, uh, a little bit of a uh a background check on eugenics.\n[1533.04] And particularly the history in the uh the 19th and 20th century.\n[1537.28] Not gonna like how it turns up, buttercup Kendall underscore with underscore one underscore L.\n[1543.68] Chris Pratt wants to kill all autistic people.\n[1547.44] Maybe she's retarded.\n[1548.80] No, actually, that was Margaret Sanger.\n[1550.32] Look into Planned Parenthood.\n[1551.52] Wow.\n[1551.84] She gotta change her name to two L's.\n[1553.28] Yeah, he wants to take out red dye from food.\n[1556.08] Or actually, I let me let me really represent Chris Pratt's position uh as accurately as I can.\n[1561.44] He doesn't want to be so mired in hatred that he blindly has to be angry about RFK Jr.\n[1567.52] doing something like removing a notable, a known toxin from children's cereal.\n[1574.16] Contrast that with Margaret Sanger, um, Planned Parenthood specifically wanted to eliminate any and all babies with birth defects.\n[1581.84] And by the way, also most black babies.\n[1584.00] Feisty underscore B 9175.\n[1587.44] What an idiot.\n[1588.72] Not surprising though.\n[1590.16] He is hyper religious and spouts Christian.\n[1593.28] That's corrected from the person who calls him an idiot.\n[1596.48] Bible verses publicly all the time.\n[1598.96] I put him up there, were I think with the other nut job has been actors like Dean Kane, Kevin Sorbo, and Jenny McCarthy.\n[1608.88] McCarthy.\n[1612.96] I've spent enough I've spent quite a bit of time with Dean Kane and Kevin Sorbo has been on the show.\n[1616.56] Uh I I know for certain that uh Dean Kane knows how to spell with.\n[1621.68] I mean, we can try.\n[1622.96] They were literally shaking typing on the comics at is it AI or Al.\n[1628.16] Some of us are old enough to remember the MAGA GOP hissy fits when Michelle Obama promoted healthier eating habits as first lady.\n[1635.28] Wonder what this Pratt had to say about that.\n[1638.32] I hate being retarded.\n[1639.84] Here's the thing.\n[1640.88] No one has a problem with somebody telling you to be healthier.\n[1644.80] The Michelle Obama campaign, right?\n[1647.76] The healthier school lunches were a complete failure again because it was predicated on the uh the idea that government could fix everything.\n[1653.12] The lunches were expensive, they were gross.\n[1655.20] Kids refused to eat them, so they just ended up trading them for other goodies and treats.\n[1659.36] It increased it waste.\n[1660.88] Kids were still hungry because they wouldn't eat the lunches.\n[1663.20] And by the way, it's at the same time as Barack Obama eliminated the presidential fitness test.\n[1667.28] So if you're going to say, hey, everyone, let's move more, let's be healthier.\n[1671.84] Great.\n[1672.40] Don't combine that with all body types are just as beautiful and healthy.\n[1676.08] And don't eliminate the presidential fitness test.\n[1678.08] It was about making people feel good no matter what they did, as opposed to being based on results.\n[1682.80] Also, the issue there is that she wasn't president and we're tired of the first lady's stupid pet projects.\n[1690.40] She's gonna stay busy.\n[1691.76] Yeah.\n[1692.88] The healthy school lunch program, just to be clear, it was about as successful and gross as Mexico's school lunch program.\n[1703.60] Muy delicioso.\n[1707.52] This has been Reddit Retards.\n[1716.64] Gerald, plug the merch store before we get to the blacks.\n[1719.20] Go to Crattershop.com right now to get this shirt, not the one that I was wearing a minute ago.\n[1723.36] There's only two genders or pro gun or pro cow poop.\n[1727.28] I don't think we have a pro cow poop.\n[1728.56] No, I'm very anti.\n[1729.68] Probably find one as a general rule.\n[1731.60] I don't know.\n[1731.92] We'll see.\n[1732.32] Pro dung.\n[1732.96] Yeah.\n[1733.36] Crowder shop.com.\n[1734.32] Find something cool.\n[1734.96] Good word, by the way.\n[1736.40] We had one employee here who literally smelled like cow poop.\n[1739.12] Really?\n[1739.60] Yeah, it was short-lived.\n[1740.56] Oh, we don't know.\n[1741.36] You know, you remember.\n[1743.36] So I don't want to get into too much detail.\n[1748.00] Uh it was I will tell you this.\n[1750.48] Look, look, for as much as people like love to bitch about the boss, we had to have meetings on how to approach uh a person who smelled so bad that other employees were complaining without hurting their feelings or sort of stepping on a legal liability landmine.\n[1766.00] Do you have any idea how difficult that is?\n[1767.92] When you have a you have employees threatening to quit because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.04] Yes.\n[1770.24] Because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.12] Yes.\n[1779.52] How about uh you start a prank war.\n[1781.04] Uh-huh.\n[1781.52] Tell them what's a prank war, and then they're the only one that gets pranked.\n[1784.32] And it's like they walk through a door and you know, soap falls on it.\n[1788.08] Yes.\n[1788.32] So they hit a tripwire as they walk by their desk, and then Fabrizio just goes.\n[1794.24] Yes, exactly.\n[1795.20] They behind a door and it's just a tool chest.\n[1797.20] Like, what was that?\n[1798.00] It was the sound of 5,000 bars of ivory coming down to stairs.\n[1802.96] I prayed to you.\n[1803.92] I covered your seat in dryer sheets.\n[1806.16] Yeah.\n[1807.36] It was uncomfortable.\n[1808.72] Speaking of uncomfortable.\n[1810.64] Guys, I did take a shower.\n[1812.88] So uh let me ask you this.\n[1814.64] Can you identify, and I'm not talking about talking heads.\n[1817.12] I'm not talking about people who are uh just in the space where they they revolve around political commentary.\n[1821.76] Can you identify a major black celebrity who's conservative?\n[1826.88] I heard Denzel Washington.\n[1828.72] Uh no, he's he's he's voted Democrat, he's a Christian, and he encourages accountability, but doesn't fully connect the dots.\n[1834.48] And by the way, I from everything that I've seen and heard like Denzel Washington, we probably would disagree on some issues politically.\n[1841.04] Uh another question for you do you think there's ever going to be a point where the scales tip?\n[1846.88] Because we saw it with Hispanic votes.\n[1848.48] We saw it with Gen Z.\n[1849.68] We've never seen it to a significant degree with black votes in America.\n[1852.64] And we have more black representatives or commentators uh than ever.\n[1857.52] You know, back when we were growing up, you pretty much had Thomas Sowell and kind of Larry Elder.\n[1861.84] Um Alan Keyes, Herman King Alfonso Rachel was an early and OG.\n[1865.76] I'd recommend go checking him out on YouTube.\n[1867.44] He was one of the first people there.\n[1868.72] But now you have a ton of people.\n[1870.16] The Blexit never really materialized.\n[1872.80] Do you think that it'll ever happen?\n[1875.36] Comment.\n[1877.68] And uh I I also understand why it's so um it's so tipped uh towards one side uh as far as politically with black people, because if you look or listen to anything in media, um, you will only see black celebrities assuming that you must be.\n[1900.16] You must be, unless you're a traitor, uh, liberal if you're black.\n[1905.92] We are voting for the right to choose what happens to our own bodies.\n[1912.64] We are damn black bitch.\n[1914.96] I choose you ourselves from this precipice of danger.\n[1920.40] Well, I misspelled respect.\n[1922.64] And a lot of these cake corrected me in a hashtag.\n[1929.36] Now I want y'all to help me correct President Trump to teach him what it means.\n[1934.48] Ladies and gentlemen, please.\n[1937.04] Nice haircut.\n[1937.92] Big loud Texas, welcome to the next president of the United States.\n[1945.28] Come on.\n[1946.80] You think that this guy has done stuff for black people.\n[1951.84] All I gotta say is crack is whack.\n[1955.84] I'm not trying to be funny.\n[1957.52] Well, mission accomplished.\n[1958.88] Nothing has never done enough for black folks.\n[1961.60] Thank you for all that.\n[1962.32] It's a double negative.\n[1963.12] That means he's done something.\n[1964.08] I know you guys are excited to see her.\n[1965.60] I didn't know you guys would be excited to see me too.\n[1967.60] But uh Yeah.\n[1969.68] I gotta go disappear to what I call training camp for a few weeks, come back with a bolts butt and ten new pounds of muscle.\n[1975.20] Now this brings us to uh the uh I keep wanting to say outnumbered, the surrounded, which for those of you who are unfamiliar, it's basically change my mind with a vote timer.\n[1986.88] Um it is, it really is.\n[1989.60] And this is one black radical.\n[1992.08] This is uh an actress, Amanda Seals, uh, versus 20 black um conservatives.\n[1997.44] Now, here's the thing.\n[1998.08] I w uh we're going to get into some of the claims versus the reality.\n[2002.48] Um, but this is important to to note, it's a technique that's used a lot.\n[2007.28] And I've encountered it in Change My Mind quite a bit.\n[2009.60] And right, Change My Mind was just sit down, establish uh the premise, which they refer to as a prompt, and anyone can sit down and you know, change your mind.\n[2018.88] Okay.\n[2019.76] You've seen people do this where what they do is the in betweens.\n[2023.04] If they know their argument doesn't really hold any water, they try and taint it with things like, you know, oh, you're unreasonable, or ugh, I can't believe these people must be paid actors.\n[2033.20] Or ugh, they try if their argument doesn't hold water, they try and tip those scales on a it's performance art.\n[2040.16] So as bad as you thought this was going to be with Amanda Seals, it's much worse.\n[2045.36] I'm not sure where your education came from, but they lied to you.\n[2048.80] I hope some of y'all are acting.\n[2050.40] I really do.\n[2051.68] I knew I was gonna be surrounded by ignorance, but damn, let's go.\n[2054.96] And my points are just as valid as yours, even though you got a pocket square and a church of Christ uh pin on your chest.\n[2061.28] Whatever.\n[2061.92] It's a cross, same difference.\n[2063.12] You got an American flag and you think you know something because you a cop.\n[2065.60] And ultimately not a cop, this much of it.\n[2067.60] It's a it's a cab all day over here.\n[2069.36] So let me make that clear.\n[2071.76] But you're literally speaking this.\n[2073.28] And you're not going to do that with me either.\n[2074.56] So you're stating your point.\n[2076.08] Y'all just want to be seen.\n[2077.44] I don't need to be seen.\n[2078.40] You're coming.\n[2078.96] That's why you're dressed like a poison dart frog.\n[2082.08] Just like she fell in the four buckets of the chimney or not.\n[2084.48] I have not had, you know, first of all, you're a light skin woman.\n[2087.84] So are you?\n[2088.48] Yes, and you're doing great cell.\n[2090.96] Yes, and so colorism really does serve us.\n[2094.00] This is scary.\n[2095.04] You need to think about me as your mama.\n[2096.88] Do not talk to me in that fashion.\n[2098.48] So let's check that now.\n[2100.16] See, and this is what happens too.\n[2101.68] Sometimes I refer to tone policing, but she's telling some, you need to do this.\n[2106.72] Now, I don't mean it's it's very reasonable to require someone if you are offering them respect to be respectful.\n[2112.48] Like, hey, I didn't, and I've done this.\n[2114.00] Hey, you know, I let you finish.\n[2115.36] Yeah.\n[2115.68] Uh you gotta let me finish.\n[2117.76] Or occasionally I'll go, you know what?\n[2119.76] I'm going to finish uh my thought as though you're an adult capable of giving the same respect I've given you.\n[2125.92] But that's not what she's doing.\n[2126.80] She's like, you need to think of me like yo mama.\n[2129.76] How entitled can you be?\n[2131.84] You don't get to tell someone what to think or how they should view you.\n[2135.20] Here's how someone's going to view you, usually.\n[2137.60] It's usually going to be based on your actions.\n[2141.20] And in this case, your words, your stupid, stupid words.\n[2145.84] So seals, just to give you an idea, was at the center of quite a few uh controversies herself.\n[2151.28] For example, defending Jesse Smollett, quote, even if it was a hoax.\n[2155.68] What?\n[2156.24] Yeah, this is someone who just if black people can do no wrong.\n[2159.92] Even if it was a hoax and cost taxpayer dollars in the and the city, and even if it did stir racial division and hatred, you know, another hoax too, like Michael Brown, hands up, don't shoot.\n[2169.68] Jesse Smallett's funny.\n[2171.04] Black lives matter, the terrorism, the billions of dollars in damage.\n[2174.00] That was also a hoax.\n[2176.00] So she was also kicked out of a black Emmy party.\n[2178.40] She got into a feud with a black sorority, and she claimed that she was autistic without ever actually being diagnosed, which is funny, but hey, it's not just black white.\n[2186.64] That's feminism to the letter.\n[2188.80] Just claim victim status, and you assume you win the argument, but that doesn't fly here.\n[2193.84] It's time for claim truth.\n[2199.44] Can we go back claiming autism as a tool in an argument?\n[2204.24] That's real retarded, sir.\n[2205.60] Sure.\n[2206.00] Yeah, it's a it's a it's a thing that a lot of people do.\n[2208.64] Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n[2209.92] The only person who never will is Al Sharpton who spells respect with two K's.\n[2215.36] Respect.\n[2216.32] I misspell respect.\n[2217.60] It's crazy.\n[2218.16] That was actually very revealing.\n[2219.20] Because to me, I just thought it's the way he speaks.\n[2220.88] No, in his mind, he's going, R E S P E KK, that is what it means to me.\n[2226.32] Yeah, there's a whole song.\n[2228.32] I don't know.\n[2229.28] I don't think I would ever get to the point in an argument where I'm like, but I'm retarded.\n[2233.04] Yeah.\n[2233.76] Well, you don't need to say it.\n[2234.72] I don't think you said in an argument, I think she was just claiming it.\n[2236.80] She's claiming it.\n[2237.52] Yeah, but why?\n[2238.24] Anyway.\n[2238.80] Because it's a status symbol to say.\n[2240.32] It's a victim.\n[2241.28] It is.\n[2241.60] It's like I'm a marginalized group.\n[2244.64] I'm I'm not only am I black, but I'm also a woman.\n[2247.20] And not only that, but I'm on the lowest end possible of being retarded.\n[2250.96] Yeah.\n[2251.20] No, no, no.\n[2251.68] I don't know.\n[2252.08] I I get it, but then you try to put yourself out there as somebody who can articulate the points of why reparations are a thing.\n[2258.00] Like you've basically just under, oh, so I don't need to listen to you.\n[2261.12] No, no, no.\n[2261.76] I understand you're being logical.\n[2262.96] That's your problem.\n[2263.84] Is if you take away victim status.\n[2265.76] Right.\n[2266.16] If you completely remove it.\n[2267.04] Okay.\n[2267.28] In other words, if you don't go, wait, black, white, okay, well, hold on a second, um, white woman, black guy, what uh trans, okay, disabled.\n[2274.00] Right.\n[2274.32] If you take all of that away, you actually have to um rest on the the validity of your arguments.\n[2282.16] Your actual thoughts.\n[2283.20] Yeah.\n[2283.52] Your opinions.\n[2284.16] So if you take all of the identity politics away, it just comes down to actions, performance, arguments, claims.\n[2293.28] We can't have that, and we certainly don't have that in the public school system.\n[2296.32] So the first claim uh that's made systemic ra and this has been addressed in changed my mind well over half a decade ago.\n[2306.08] Actually, systemic racism, by the way, challenge is still out there of one example today in the 21st century.\n[2311.04] Systemic racism is real, says the self-diagnosed retard.\n[2314.96] Ultimately, systemic racism exists in our institutions on a government level in our institutions, whether it's prisons or schools, and it is undeniable because they are actively trying to reinstate it right now.\n[2329.44] Okay.\n[2330.08] So the truth, it's hard to deal with claims that make no sense.\n[2334.72] I don't know what you mean by trying to reinstate it.\n[2336.40] And I watched the whole thing, and it still doesn't make sense.\n[2338.48] Uh blacks are completely proportionally represented in Congress, right?\n[2341.52] In government, okay, about 14%.\n[2343.68] And uh, as far as prison, now again, her premise, but again, she's she's on the spectrum according to her, is just black people are being put there because they're black.\n[2351.52] Black people in this country, despite making up twelve to thirteen percent of the population commit over half of all the violent crimes.\n[2358.08] And then if you look at wait systemic discrimination, okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students.\n[2360.00] Okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students who are woefully underqualified in some cases, they do.\n[2373.92] They do get in.\n[2374.72] DEI exists.\n[2377.20] And here's the thing, too.\n[2378.08] When she goes on to talk about reparations, they act as though those things have never taken place.\n[2383.12] DEI is reparational.\n[2384.40] Affirmative action is reparations.\n[2385.76] Model Cities program is reparations.\n[2387.92] EBT, SNAP, the baby mama that was created by these are reparations.\n[2391.68] Section 8 housing, more money into public school.\n[2394.32] These are reparations that have been paid to the tune of trillions of dollars and have made nothing better.\n[2400.64] Now she may say those aren't the reparations we want, but those are the reparations that exist because it's what their party and what their community, the black community, have demanded.\n[2408.96] They petitioned, they got these reparations, and it didn't work.\n[2415.04] The answer, if you ask them, so when is it enough is always more.\n[2419.60] Here's the next claim that she makes.\n[2423.12] And this is a tough one.\n[2424.24] I don't even know.\n[2424.88] It's like grabbing a bar of soap.\n[2426.64] Uh soap.\n[2428.08] Which kind of soap, yeah.\n[2429.52] Done so.\n[2430.56] Harriet Tubman was uh actually aided by white supremacy something.\n[2436.40] I refuse to embrace a victim mentality because that's not what our grandparents and Harriet Tugman and those people fall for.\n[2442.96] They fought for whatever.\n[2444.00] Do not bring that Harriet Tubman's name in vain, baby.\n[2447.52] Please name in vain.\n[2451.20] Harriet Tubman was literally, literally saving her family and others from slavery.\n[2460.00] Yeah.\n[2460.80] You know who helped her white people.\n[2462.64] You know who helped her.\n[2463.68] They were on the underground railroad.\n[2465.04] No, no, no, no, you know, helped her.\n[2466.96] Come on, even though you know who helped her?\n[2469.44] Guy.\n[2470.16] And there are people who benefit from white supremacy.\n[2473.36] What?\n[2474.40] That guy had answers.\n[2475.60] Yeah, he did.\n[2476.64] He did.\n[2477.52] Uh, okay, so the truth to this one.\n[2481.52] I uh uh okay.\n[2483.76] So here's my understanding of her uh of her uh again, self-diagnosed uh autistic argument is that um white people helped Harriet Tubman, but they could only help her because they were beneficiaries of white supremacy, therefore white supremacy helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2499.60] Okay, so you don't want allies.\n[2502.48] Get it done with 12% of the population.\n[2505.44] I would help, but I benefit from white supremacy.\n[2508.40] Everyone in this room, by the way, you're precluded from helping because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2512.40] Tell that to the Quaker Church who helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2515.20] Yeah.\n[2515.76] Tell it to Massachusetts Governor uh John Andrew.\n[2518.96] Tell it to the multiple whites who helped with the underground railroad specifically, just to be clear.\n[2524.56] No, no, no, you guys all have to stop because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2528.56] Oh, so the slaves should do it on their own.\n[2531.04] This is a way of removing any and all credit for the good deeds that white people have committed.\n[2538.00] In the name of I know this is inconvenient.\n[2540.32] Modern Christianom.\n[2541.76] Yeah.\n[2542.40] I don't understand what what this point like if you didn't have white people, nobody would know about Harriet Tubman.\n[2548.08] You know why?\n[2549.04] She wouldn't have made it.\n[2550.08] We wouldn't let you write books about it, and you wouldn't be free.\n[2553.04] Mm-hmm.\n[2553.84] So maybe just saying thank you.\n[2556.24] You know who else is the benefit uh who's benefited from white supremacy?\n[2559.52] Um, the wealthiest celebrities on earth.\n[2561.92] There you go.\n[2562.48] Beyonce, NJZ, the top box office draws of the night, the uh Will Smith of the world, the Denzel Washington's of the world, the three most recognizable faces on earth in the 90s, Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson, kind of, that's a half one, Mike Tyson.\n[2576.08] Because white people you know who else?\n[2577.44] Barack Obama, president of the United States.\n[2579.28] I know that one's pretty crazy.\n[2580.72] That's rough.\n[2581.44] Also, white people, the ones who've given you the platform to speak these kinds of asinine opinions uh in a show like surrounded, not outnumbered.\n[2592.00] Surrounded.\n[2592.56] The next claim that she makes.\n[2595.28] That blacks absolutely do need reparations, and she's gonna make an airtight case.\n[2600.24] Now, let me land the plane.\n[2601.52] We're talking about reparations, and what you're doing is actually female pilot.\n[2606.32] The fact is reparations are just and necessary because on a basic level, black people built this country, and the country continues to thrive off of the labor that black people put into this country, and it would behoove you, young man, to really understand the way that your ancestors put blood, sweat, and tears into this nation that is still living off of those blood, sweat and tears.\n[2628.80] Okay, and I'll open this up to you guys, but here's the truth.\n[2630.72] All right, couple of things.\n[2631.76] I just addressed this, right?\n[2632.88] When you talk about EBT snap, section eight housing, more money to public schools, when you talk about affirmative action, DEI.\n[2638.32] These are all forms of reparations, to be clear.\n[2640.88] I think at some point she says repatriations.\n[2642.56] I'm not entirely sure she kind of delineates between the two.\n[2644.80] Remunerations.\n[2645.52] Is that what she says?\n[2646.08] Yeah, remunerations, sorry.\n[2647.36] Renumerations.\n[2648.48] Um.\n[2651.04] And she'll say, well, that's not what now we're asking for money.\n[2653.52] Okay, great, but those things exist because your community and the Democrat Party said that those were required.\n[2660.40] Okay?\n[2661.04] Those were required.\n[2662.00] That's the rep to the tune of trillions of dollars.\n[2664.88] Why is that not enough?\n[2666.16] And by the way, why do reparations need to be paid to a 15-year-old black guy?\n[2672.24] What kind of reparations does Jesse Smallett deserve?\n[2675.12] And is it wiped out by what he costs the good good taxpaying citizens of Chicago?\n[2680.96] I know you say you should defend him anyway because it's just a hoax.\n[2683.68] Oh, that's right.\n[2684.40] Now I'm getting it.\n[2685.44] The answer is always more money, please, more money, please.\n[2688.88] You asked for reparations.\n[2691.28] You may not like them now.\n[2692.56] It's what you asked for.\n[2694.64] You got them.\n[2696.64] You're saying it's not enough.\n[2698.88] Now you're on your own.\n[2700.40] The other thing is, by the way, I'm so tired of this.\n[2702.96] All references available, link in the descriptions.\n[2705.60] Um blacks built this country.\n[2708.08] No, they didn't.\n[2709.44] No, they didn't.\n[2710.64] In comparison to the labor in this country, and certainly in comparison to the businesses created and the innovations uh in this country, and yes, manual labor, especially if you look at the industrial revolution.\n[2722.48] You look at these great booms that took place in this country.\n[2725.28] It is not because of black people.\n[2728.56] They took part in it, but not any greater part than any well.\n[2732.72] 75%, by the way, of Southerners didn't own any slaves whatsoever.\n[2735.76] States like California never had any slaves, to be clear.\n[2738.96] And while we're talking about this, the vast majority of slaves, anywhere from 90% to 96%, I think the high number, 96% comes from Cornell West.\n[2747.68] Uh, they were sold into slavery by West African slave traders.\n[2752.40] Also, if you want to go buy yourself a slave today, you can still do it in plenty of African nations.\n[2757.76] You're gonna be dealing with a black person, though, so don't be surprised.\n[2761.36] Here's the next part of this is um slavery, too, actually can be argued through the metrics, it held the country back.\n[2770.00] The free North outperformed the South while they still had slaves in every way you could measure economically.\n[2778.08] The cotton industry exploded after slavery ended.\n[2781.52] Innovations like the cotton gin that came from the areas of the country that didn't have slavery.\n[2786.08] So this is something, and it's something that used to it's used to guilt white people.\n[2789.76] You wouldn't have this country if not for black people.\n[2792.08] Okay, well, black people, Africans who were sold by their African brothers.\n[2796.56] Hey, they're still there in countries in Africa.\n[2799.36] What does that look like?\n[2801.84] What's the difference?\n[2804.00] You have Africans and both.\n[2806.40] They're slaves in both.\n[2808.96] Slavery's wrong, to be clear, just like Hitler, bad.\n[2811.92] Africans in both slavery and slave owners alike in both.\n[2816.24] Pick a country, any country.\n[2818.64] The African continent, United States.\n[2820.56] What's the difference?\n[2821.52] Who built the country?\n[2824.08] One of the most infuriating things that she does is she makes these claims as though they're self-evident, right?\n[2829.20] She just says, yes, systemic racism exists.\n[2831.52] We were trying to think about, okay, well, how do you combat that without going down 50 rabbit holes?\n[2835.28] Okay, we'll go with what she said.\n[2836.40] Government prisons and schools.\n[2837.60] Okay, well, you can't prove that because we just disproved that.\n[2840.32] Reparations are absolutely just and needed.\n[2842.64] Okay, well, how do you prove that?\n[2844.08] Who gets it?\n[2845.04] Right.\n[2845.60] These people, we built this country, therefore, she goes to the next point as though that foundational statement is true.\n[2852.00] I just wish she would say something with some kind of factual backing.\n[2856.40] Quote a study, even if I don't agree with it, just something, a stat.\n[2860.00] Give me a number to go after.\n[2861.76] In fact, when the guy brought up statistics about black on black crime, she goes, stats lie all the time, honey.\n[2867.20] If you're gonna make your argument about stats, you already lost.\n[2870.08] Yeah.\n[2870.48] It's exactly what she did.\n[2871.44] It's like, oh, so I will never ever, you're just a racist person.\n[2874.64] Yeah.\n[2874.96] That's really what we're dealing with.\n[2876.08] They're a racist person who hates this country.\n[2878.24] Fantastic.\n[2878.88] Here's an offer from me.\n[2880.48] Not this show, from me personally.\n[2882.24] I will write you a check right now to pay to have you move to Africa.\n[2885.28] Let me Because apparently you don't like it here.\n[2887.20] Yeah.\n[2887.52] Let me ask you.\n[2888.08] I don't want to be, I don't want to be an oppressor.\n[2889.60] No, no, none of us do.\n[2890.48] Let me ask you this.\n[2891.04] If you went to Harriet Tubman back in time and said, hey, look, you can you can tomorrow, slavery is done.\n[2897.28] You don't have to do this railroad stuff.\n[2898.96] Okay, it's done.\n[2900.08] It's over.\n[2900.72] This railroad stuff.\n[2901.60] Everyone will be free.\n[2902.72] Everyone will be free.\n[2903.76] Oh, that's malarkey.\n[2905.04] But that's it.\n[2905.52] It's a fresh start.\n[2906.24] The only way we know how to do this, Miss Tubman, you've inspired us, is to break these chains.\n[2910.88] Slavery is done, but we just got to get a fresh start.\n[2912.80] We can't keep looking to the past.\n[2914.00] It's over.\n[2914.48] Everyone's free.\n[2915.68] Do you think of course she would take that deal.\n[2917.76] And if she saw seal, she would tell her to get a haircut and sew up the holes in her genes.\n[2921.60] Here's a bonus claim that she makes that uh just sort of shows that she's an actual racist.\n[2927.04] If you didn't know that by her defending Jesse Smollett because of his blackness, uh the claim here is that the Chinese aren't actual minorities or something like black people.\n[2936.32] I don't know.\n[2936.96] For example, we have the uh Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n[2939.68] We prevented Chinese people from getting citizenship and even entering the country, we discriminate against them, and basically put them under apartheid, even here in the United States.\n[2947.68] Yet they have the highest median household income.\n[2949.52] How is that possible?\n[2950.56] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to pay for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time?\n[2957.20] Which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2950.64] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to beg for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time, which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2960.32] Oh, young Matt.\n[2961.60] One, comparing Chinese people who are immigrants that made a choice to come to the United States and comparing the continued effort of black people to ground themselves in a nation that continues to make impediments for them to show and live and exist in their true citizenship is a false equivalency.\n[2979.28] I don't believe that happens at all.\n[2980.24] What a what no one here is in the world?\n[2982.16] Are you acting right now?\n[2983.12] Do you really believe that?\n[2984.80] There's a way to try and discredit the person.\n[2986.88] Yeah.\n[2987.60] Now, before I get to the truth, let me just tell you this.\n[2989.68] I'm also, I think that you're placating by saying black people kill black people in record numbers.\n[2994.80] Because that's a you know what I'm actually really concerned with?\n[2997.92] I'm also really concerned with the fact that black people kill white people in this country in record numbers.\n[3002.40] It's not just your community's problem.\n[3004.64] No.\n[3005.28] And we have a right to an opinion because we are several times more likely to be assaulted, to be mugged, to be robbed, or to be killed by a black person as a white American than by a white American.\n[3015.20] Yep, the numbers are even higher because of the proximity effect of black people living around other black people.\n[3020.08] But let's be honest about this.\n[3022.40] We're concerned that we're more likely to be the victim of crime, and you can't blame it on there not being enough affirmative action.\n[3030.80] Anyone want to c anyone agree with that?\n[3032.64] I'm tired of going, oh, the black on black crime, they're the biggest yeah, sure, they're the biggest threat to the black community.\n[3037.44] I'm very concerned with them being a threat, that community to my white children.\n[3042.00] Got it.\n[3042.64] That's a great point because in this the the longer version of the video, you know, other people brought that up.\n[3049.04] And it is a real concern.\n[3050.40] But she her response was uh, well, how many how many black people do you see uh in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3056.32] A lot.\n[3056.64] How many white people do you see in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3058.96] Uh some.\n[3059.76] Well, uh that well, then that's not that's why.\n[3061.60] That's you're not you're not in danger from white people because you don't see white people.\n[3064.48] Yeah, yeah.\n[3065.12] The only problem is if you look at the armed robbery, you look at the burglaries, you look at the violent crime taking place in the white neighborhoods, you know, the next town over, you still see the same stats.\n[3075.20] In other words, these gangs of largely black people, they travel.\n[3080.08] And we have a problem with it.\n[3081.52] Brown round get around, they get around.\n[3084.24] The browns, browns, browns, browns, they get around.\n[3088.24] Shh.\n[3090.48] But here's the truth.\n[3091.84] Uh the Chinese in the United States.\n[3094.32] It's not a false equivalent.\n[3095.36] See, they weren't even considered citizens until 1943.\n[3098.24] 1870.\n[3099.44] Wow.\n[3099.76] Is when the 15th Amendment gave black men the right to vote, to be clear.\n[3104.16] 1920, the 19th Amendment, some would say a mistake granted black women the right to vote.\n[3109.12] Not because they're black, all women.\n[3110.88] And uh today, yes, the median income for Chinese Americans is 82,000 versus 54,000 for black Americans.\n[3117.68] So they've been discriminated against far more recently, in a way that would negatively affect their income.\n[3121.92] They bounce back.\n[3123.36] And by the way, richer than the average German, just to be clear.\n[3126.72] Like the Chinese do really well.\n[3128.72] You keep saying it wrong.\n[3130.08] The Chinese.\n[3130.88] Thanks.\n[3131.20] Sorry, it's pronounced Chinese.\n[3132.48] Finally admonish me.\n[3133.60] Yes.\n[3133.92] Admonish him alone.\n[3134.88] I don't want to be ethnocentric.\n[3136.72] Do it a lot.\n[3138.64] Chinese go down with the ship, Jim.\n[3141.04] And by the way, these metrics show you uh they Chinese, they know dumb.\n[3143.84] They are doing very well.\n[3146.48] So I don't know why it's plural in other countries, but it is.\n[3148.72] Hey, so what let's let's just concede the argument that she makes right now.\n[3152.16] I just want to concede every single point, right?\n[3153.84] I know we don't want to do that, but let's just concede.\n[3155.68] Every single thing you say about white people in this country, white supremacists and Harriet Tubman, systemic racism everywhere.\n[3162.00] You're right, you're owed every single dollar in my bank account.\n[3165.04] Do you think that's going to happen?\n[3167.76] And is that the best advice for all of your constituents to try to get that?\n[3172.72] Or let's just say that they're an oppressive system that they can never get out of, which is kind of what you're claiming in the first place.\n[3178.08] Wouldn't it be better to do what the other cultures have done and just try to make the very best of it that you possibly can and try to fix that instead of just complaining and shaking your fist at the sky and saying every bad thing that happens to you is because of the white man keeping you down?\n[3191.60] That's what works.\n[3192.88] You don't care about your community.\n[3194.48] Yeah.\n[3194.80] You care about having a grievance.\n[3196.40] You care about having an excuse for failure.\n[3199.60] Right.\n[3200.24] Instead of saying, hey, we need more fathers in the home in this community.\n[3204.16] Hey, we need less violence in this community.\n[3206.00] Hey, we need better education in this community.\n[3208.08] And guess what?\n[3208.96] Those people aren't gonna give it to us.\n[3210.64] Fine.\n[3211.12] We're gonna do it ourselves.\n[3212.32] Yeah.\n[3212.72] I tell you who really wants preparations.\n[3215.20] Chrysler.\n[3216.24] Oh, I thought you said pre I thought you said preparations, and I was thinking it's big H.\n[3220.48] No.\n[3221.36] No.\n[3221.84] Reparations.\n[3223.44] I'm not gonna say it.\n[3224.16] And by the way, bring up a bonus uh for uh those who are members of Rumble Premium for Mug Club.\n[3228.16] By the way, if you're not click that button below, we'll go on for another hour.\n[3231.44] Uh it's 99 dollars, you get everything ad-free, you get 100% more show, including the Friday show, and uh it's the only thing that keeps the lights on, or try for 999 a month, where they talked about with her uh black culture, and they talked about hip hop and the things that were glorified, and she said, Well, who's the one feeding black people that?\n[3248.48] Who's the one so if if they're force feeding you junk food, and in other words, it's white people who are largely responsible for the mass consumption in the black community and rejection by the way of any and all other forms of media as it relates to gangster culture as it relates to decadence and hedonism that you see.\n[3267.84] Um, I would have loved to ask her, what's on your playlist?\n[3271.36] Yeah.\n[3272.48] What do you think's on Jesse Smollett's playlist?\n[3274.80] Why have you been dubbed duped by the evil white man?\n[3278.08] I'm guessing Jew, right?\n[3279.36] Why have you been duped?\n[3281.68] It is our fault.\n[3282.56] Yeah.\n[3282.88] We men of the bucket and the mop.\n[3284.64] Yes.\n[3285.28] Yes.\n[3286.16] Yeah.\n[3286.88] It's uh, which is after which she modeled her hairdo.\n[3290.16] Um was the other thing.\n[3292.00] Do we have a do we have a left versus reality stinger, or is it a claim truth?\n[3296.64] Uh left.\n[3298.00] We don't have any stinger for this one.\n[3299.36] Oh we just have left versus things.\n[3301.20] Yeah.\n[3301.44] I can claim truth again, but really.\n[3307.20] You know, he's been making the rounds.\n[3308.72] He's been making a lot of progress.\n[3310.56] And yesterday, he met with some of the uh some people say Euro trash.\n[3315.52] I would never say that.\n[3316.24] Leaders in DC.\n[3317.84] And it all started off before we get to some of the claims from the left where they really want this administration to fail.\n[3324.32] And by that I mean they really want never-ending war.\n[3327.44] Um, it all kicked off with a warm welcome to Zelensky who put on a suit, sort of.\n[3333.60] I guess he got the message.\n[3347.76] Trump is on your message for the people of Ukraine.\n[3350.00] We're all right.\n[3351.76] We love them.\n[3353.04] We love them.\n[3360.48] Thank you very much, everybody goes.\n[3362.88] Couple of things there.\n[3363.92] First off, when he goes, this is the best I have, this suit, change it.\n[3368.24] That's why we think you're a disrespectful little prick.\n[3371.04] Stop by men's warehouse, get a two for one.\n[3375.12] And I look, look, this is the thing too.\n[3376.88] It's funny, right?\n[3377.52] Where people are talking about all cultures, hey, hey.\n[3380.40] It's a custom here.\n[3382.16] It just so happens to be a custom on the greatest country on earth.\n[3386.56] Put on a fucking suit.\n[3389.12] President Trump also, it's not a big deal.\n[3391.60] It's just respect our culture.\n[3393.44] You know.\n[3394.40] President Trump also, uh, by the way, was in rare form.\n[3397.12] Uh he had personalized greetings for each, I would never say Euro Trash leader.\n[3401.84] Everyone knows President Macron of France, who's been with me from the beginning, one of the first people I met as a foreign dignitary, and uh I like them from day one.\n[3414.88] And I like him even more now.\n[3416.56] That's pretty good.\n[3417.44] That's unusual.\n[3419.12] That's a pretty unusual thing.\n[3421.20] Prime Minister Maloney of Italy, who's a uh really great leader and an inspiration over there.\n[3427.84] She's uh she's served now, even though she's a very young person, she's served there for a long period of time relative to others.\n[3435.04] They don't they don't last very long.\n[3436.72] You've lasted a long time.\n[3438.40] You're gonna be there a long time.\n[3439.92] Chancellor Mertz of Germany, who is uh just put your Biden in this role person, right?\n[3446.48] And a very strong leader and very highly respected, and he's my friend, and it's another friend.\n[3453.28] Thank you very much.\n[3457.60] I want to I want to get a 10 like that.\n[3460.48] Where'd you get it?\n[3461.36] I get mine from a machine.\n[3464.24] I stand and go, whoa.\n[3466.32] Here's the thing.\n[3467.04] You may not like it, but the guy has something to offer in basic communications.\n[3473.20] Like well, but they got people to to laugh.\n[3475.12] You're there for a very serious subject.\n[3476.64] You compliment people, you got them laughing.\n[3478.96] He understands how to work a room.\n[3481.04] Well, one of the biggest lies that we were ever told, and they still try and sell is you know, we're being mocked, we're being uh we're we're the laughing stock of the international stage.\n[3489.12] Comment below.\n[3489.76] Does anyone actually believe that other leaders, the international community respected us more with Biden at the helm?\n[3497.04] Does anyone actually genuine comment?\n[3499.04] Right there, they're laughing and like, ah, this guy, you're in core you're incorrigible or whatever generic you're incorrigible.\n[3505.20] That's Finland.\n[3506.40] Wasn't Maloney the one that had to redirect him back to the meeting when they were doing the the D-Day memorial?\n[3512.72] I think so.\n[3513.52] She was the one that walked over and like grabbed him and was like, hey, by the way, be respectful.\n[3517.76] It's over here.\n[3518.64] Yeah.\n[3518.96] Yeah, exactly.\n[3519.60] This is where your country liberated our continent.\n[3522.32] Chocolate chip.\n[3524.08] By the way, so there were some all-time, all-time great photo ops, including President Trump showing off his hat collection.\n[3531.92] It's like, look, there's so many hats.\n[3534.88] That is hilarious.\n[3536.08] That was it's an episode of Gribs.\n[3538.64] That one right there goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3547.04] Still got uh it's a little blood there.\n[3540.48] Goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3546.96] Still got uh there's a little blood there.\n[3550.00] That's why it's red.\n[3551.04] I love that hat.\n[3552.48] I wish it's red on red, but it reminds me of the fact that I lived that God loves me more than you.\n[3567.76] Actually, all sport.\n[3569.12] I have to buy this on eBay.\n[3570.48] It's vintage.\n[3571.20] They stopped making it.\n[3572.32] Show the new Oval Office.\n[3573.52] This is where the magic happened.\n[3576.08] If you like it, it's all gold.\n[3577.92] I think it's a circle.\n[3579.04] Here's another uh picture.\n[3580.40] There's uh um what's in that the next one?\n[3583.28] Oh, yeah, this this picture of all the leaders gathered around the resolute desk.\n[3586.24] Look at that.\n[3587.12] They're all around there.\n[3587.84] I love how you like crammed him in.\n[3589.04] Like, you can all get closer.\n[3590.32] I need all this space.\n[3592.24] And uh the best.\n[3593.84] Here's a cap uh caption uh on X, because we put this out there.\n[3597.92] Um who posed can you bring it up?\n[3599.44] Who posted this?\n[3600.24] Huge huge wrote uh when you and your boys get caught being the weak men who create hard times.\n[3607.52] A runner up to it, uh Cole Hetty Lamar uh wrote Maloney.\n[3611.52] I was told there would be antipasto.\n[3616.72] I still don't fully know what that's it's like uh it's like appetizers in Italy.\n[3620.64] Yes, yes, okay.\n[3621.44] Well now I think she's the Italian, yeah.\n[3623.20] I just thought it was like something that didn't like the pasta.\n[3626.24] Okay, hey, and it's like cheese and wine and stuff like that.\n[3630.08] It's not enough to be anti this thing.\n[3631.92] You gotta get your own thing.\n[3633.20] Now, this picture may have been the best one right here.\n[3636.48] Look at that.\n[3636.96] It's the worst Avengers movie ever.\n[3641.28] But to be clear, they were also getting ready for the evening's festivities.\n[3645.12] I want it.\n[3649.44] We figure we throw it in.\n[3651.12] That's cohesion, huh?\n[3652.08] Yeah, no.\n[3653.60] So, and we're going to get to you're wrong about everything here, and the references are all available link in the description.\n[3659.60] This means that legacy media, seeing the man who's not supposed to be respected by the international community being unilaterally respected by the international community, seeing the man who was supposed to be a feckless, ineffective celebrity president being incredibly effective and accomplishing what no other leader's been able to do for years.\n[3675.68] Um, well, that made them spurg, and that means that they're completely up in arms, uh, accusing Donald Trump of abandoning Europe, doing Putin's bidding, you know, the same tired talking points that don't really apply, but they still try and apply him.\n[3688.64] The president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, decided to have a meeting with him, and then decided to invite him to the United States of America.\n[3697.60] He didn't have to do that.\n[3698.80] And then you're showing it, rolled out literally a red carpet for him.\n[3703.20] Putin clearly won.\n[3704.48] There's no world in which Donald Trump he doesn't like multilateral meetings because he likes to be able to bully people on their own.\n[3709.92] It's unusual.\n[3711.28] All the stuff you just saw doesn't even happen for our democratic allies.\n[3714.88] Got a flyover, a red carpet, fly.\n[3716.96] A lot of handshakes.\n[3718.32] A lot of great state TV coverage back called.\n[3720.80] How many times have you seen any of our democratic allies or NATO allies or allies in Asia treated like that?\n[3727.20] It doesn't even have to be.\n[3768.32] From former U.S.\n[3769.28] Secretary of State and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, here's what she has to say.\n[3775.28] This post she just put out a short time ago.\n[3777.68] She says, if Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.\n[3788.32] Does this let me ask you this?\n[3789.44] Does this actually work on anybody?\n[3791.04] Does that kind of assholery work on anybody?\n[3794.24] If if without Ukraine ceding any territory, tell me when that's ever happened in the history of mankind.\n[3799.92] An inferior nation militarily, and if not for Western Mike coming to help them, coming to terms in a war that they're losing without compromising anything.\n[3810.72] Oh, okay.\n[3811.60] You're trying to set up a standard that could never possibly be met.\n[3814.48] And as the as for the man saying they're gonna gaslight.\n[3818.24] Do you mean like gaslighting in the way that you said these leaders wouldn't meet with Donald Trump in the way that you said these leaders have no respect for President Trump?\n[3828.08] Because we're going to get to the exact words from these leaders while they were all meeting on one side of the table with Donald Trump.\n[3835.36] And let's keep that in mind, the word gaslighting.\n[3837.60] It's time for why everything you say.\n[3841.12] You're wrong about everything.\n[3846.48] Wrong.\n[3847.76] All right, let's start with the left.\n[3849.52] So what they say is that Friday's meeting with Putin was stupid, pointless, and uh something.\n[3854.96] Well, I think last Friday, that Alaska summit was one of the most disastrous summits that I can think of.\n[3860.64] Oh no.\n[3861.44] Uh did no good in terms of advancing America's interests or the interests of our allies or Ukraine.\n[3867.60] And we treated this horrible dictator who terrorizes Ukrainians every single night, as you just showed by killing them through these attacks on civilians.\n[3877.92] Uh, we treated him like he was some special uh friend of the United States.\n[3882.08] Okay, here's the reality.\n[3883.76] Okay.\n[3884.96] The NATO Secretary General Mark Root thanked President Trump.\n[3888.48] He didn't say it's completely pointless, rolled out a red carpet.\n[3891.52] He thanked President Trump for being the only person in years to finally break the deadlock.\n[3899.68] His words.\n[3907.36] Basically, uh with President Putin by starting the dialogue.\n[3910.96] And I think it was in February that you had to first phone call, and from there, we are now where we are today.\n[3917.28] Uh and that is uh, I think if we play this well, we could end it.\n[3921.52] And we have to end it.\n[3922.56] We have to stop the killing, we have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure.\n[3926.88] It is a terrible war.\n[3928.48] Um, so I'm I'm really excited.\n[3930.80] By the way, that man's not a conservative as you would know it to be in the United States.\n[3935.20] So you have the left in the United States.\n[3937.12] This is not it's accomplished nothing.\n[3938.48] He's sucking up to him, and you have that man, the man who would know, thanking President Trump for breaking the deadlock.\n[3947.12] Does that sound like we're less respected in the international?\n[3950.24] You know who didn't break the deadlock?\n[3952.16] Biden.\n[3952.96] Here's another one.\n[3953.84] The left.\n[3954.56] They claim that President Trump is still sucking up to Putin.\n[3959.20] What the Europeans are coming to give Trump some support, some ballast.\n[3963.92] By the way, join Rumble Premium because we have to go.\n[3965.68] We're running late.\n[3966.16] If not, you're gonna see Tim Poole.\n[3967.52] Cut it.\n[3968.08] I mean, I'm not sure.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

you are unfamiliar with Adal, kind of like manual windows.\n[187.36] We realized that after yesterday's sketch, but I think you get it in principle.\n[191.12] Welcome uh viewers coming in from Vince.\n[193.12] Uh of course, Bon Gino Army.\n[194.80] We're glad to have you here.\n[195.52] I know that Bonino has some assistance over there at the uh the old FBI, which reminds me.\n[200.40] Is James Comey okay?\n[202.40] I mean, I know he's a cross dresser, tell everybody, but I don't know if he's okay when you see his latest video.\n[207.68] We're gonna talk about that today.\n[208.64] He's a swifty.\n[212.48] He's a swifty, and s and old Swift inspired him to stand up against Trump.\n[217.04] And by stand up against Trump, I mean lie about Donald Trump and try and destroy his career, his credibility, and his livelihood.\n[222.48] So we're gonna talk about that.\n[223.44] It's no small thing.\n[224.56] Chris Pratt was on with Bill Maher.\n[226.72] Um I like Chris Pratt.\n[229.76] There was a uh a black leftist.\n[233.36] Picture her in your head.\n[234.48] Yep.\n[236.08] On Jubilee, I think it's what is it called?\n[238.16] Uh surrounded with 20 black conservatives.\n[240.40] That's fun, and it shows you everything wrong with black liberalism today.\n[243.04] And hey, is there headway to be made?\n[244.40] That's my question to you.\n[245.68] Remember the black sit sort of uh or sorry, Blex it never really materialized.\n[249.68] And we saw a huge shift in Latino votes, Hispanic votes, where younger Hispanic men are now actually voting uh as a majority Republican block.\n[257.84] Do you see that oscillation that's never really shifted with the black American vote ever going Republican?\n[263.12] And I don't mean in social media world, I mean in the real world.\n[265.28] Then of course, most important President Trump uh had his meeting with Zelensky, and um the left wants us to fail, and by that, I mean they want more war.\n[276.00] Either you want President Trump to succeed, and he is right now.\n[278.80] We're making a lot of headway here, which is good for Americans, or you want him to fail, in which case you want perpetual war.\n[285.36] By the way, the next commercial you're about to see, it's a new sponsor.\n[288.24] There's a lot of legal stuff that had to be included at the end.\n[291.04] So we'll see.\n[293.20] Yeah, I thought that was a kid's pool toys, the squeakers.\n[299.44] Sound I'll never forget.\n[306.72] Oh, hey, scene is Would you just would you just drive up it?\n[311.60] I'm a Claren.\n[313.52] That's like a 200,000 dollar car.\n[316.16] But that one out there.\n[317.20] Well.\n[320.56] It's a $50,000 Rolex, Billy.\n[322.88] Yeah, I guess it is, yeah.\n[324.40] New suit.\n[325.52] Yeah, it's great, isn't it?\n[327.84] Weren't you and I just having a conversation last week about your credit score being shot?\n[333.36] Was that last week?\n[334.56] Last week.\n[335.52] Oh.\n[338.24] No, it's not anybody's guess.\n[340.16] This is what it is, Billy.\n[342.24] 200,000 car, a $50,000 watch, and I remani's suit.\n[347.44] It's a mystery.\n[348.40] No, there's no mystery.\n[349.44] Your

the thing I will say.\n[469.04] I will say this kickoff, and it's one of the few products I wearing a couple of things.\n[472.00] It's one of the few products that I don't use because I have stellar credit.\n[475.20] But uh it's really useful and it works, but there's so much stuff that needs to be included.\n[479.28] We were like, do we re uh okay, all right, but I do recommend it.\n[482.24] If

yeah.\n[507.28] Still one of the hardest uh times I've ever left in my life was you voicing Donald Trump Donald Duck being raped.\n[515.28] By the way, I don't say that to be profane, that's an actual thing that Doug do.\n[518.24] They do it to establish a pecking order.\n[520.72] Established!\n[523.60] Oh yeah, I got a lake in front of my house, dude.\n[525.52] It's sex city out there.\n[526.64] Dude, there are not people think it's orgy town.\n[529.76] What was Toolman?\n[530.56] You just went to color bars?\n[531.52] What was that?\n[532.00] Yeah, that was uh I thought it was kind of cool.\n[533.68] Wrong.\n[534.16] Alright.\n[534.64] Can you admonish yourself?\n[536.08] Hey, the good news is you can tune in to this level of quality every weekday, 11 a.m.\n[539.36] Eastern.\n[540.08] Captain Morgan, CEO, I know you're well.\n[541.92] Friday and Saturday, August 22nd and 23rd in Portland, Oregon, Helium Comedy Club.\n[546.96] Uh Josh Eerstein looking uh looking very 90s-ish with the hair product down the middle, but it'll make sense.\n[552.08] I don't know.\n[555.68] Too late, bad.\n[556.32] It's this weekend, by the way, in Portland.\n[557.84] Yeah.\n[558.32] Yeah.\n[558.64] Yeah.\n[559.04] I thought you were saying it was this week in like a Dawson's Creek reunion.\n[562.08] That's also happening in Portland.\n[563.36] We're gonna burn down a precinct that's gonna be great.\n[565.12] I liked Pacey.\n[566.00] I love how by the way, one of the assistants just brought in another shirt for Gerald.\n[570.08] Because he's so I thought she was gonna I thought she's gonna come in.\n[575.44] I thought she was gonna come in and be like, uh, kickoff has kicked us off.\n[578.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[580.16] All right.\n[580.88] Uh while Gerald was getting changed.\n[583.04] By the way, nice traps.\n[584.64] Yeah, good traps on that guy.\n[586.64] Hair all over him.\n[587.36] It's a stuff of children's nightmares.\n[588.96] So let me ask you this before I move on.\n[591.04] Uh hey, uh, you know all cultures are equal.\n[593.92] Mm-hmm.\n[594.72] Hell.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[599.28] Ping.\n[590.16] This before I move on.\n[591.52] Hey, uh, you know, all cultures are equal.\n[594.72] Oh.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[600.16] Cow dung.\n[601.12] Can't be a luxury skincare.\n[602.88] Think again.\n[603.76] This is cowpeti's lavender and fun seed soap, a patented formula.\n[608.40] That is a pure genius.\n[610.08] Made from dry, beautified cow dung from indigenous cow blended with living.\n[614.72] Beautiful seeds and uh gotta be in indigenous cow dung.\n[619.44] DP hybrids and even helps heal skin issues like eczema wounds and mood.\n[624.88] It forms a legend.\n[626.56] Smells amazing from the start to finish, and outlaws so it says no paravents, no sulfates, no toxins, just clean seats gear.\n[637.20] Speak from nature.\n[638.32] Copetti wellness through mother go.\n[641.20] A couple of things that really are upsetting with that.\n[643.20] Number one is that someone will actually look at that and go, oh no, parabens.\n[646.56] That's good.\n[646.96] Yeah, you should be more concerned with the cow shit.\n[649.60] That's true.\n[650.24] I like that it's it says cowpathy, but she pronounces it cowpatty.\n[653.92] Yeah, exactly.\n[654.72] Yeah, I think that's very accurate.\n[656.16] She says outlast soap, but it sounds like outlaw soap.\n[660.24] This shower ain't big enough for the two of us.\n[663.28] And uh also when we say all cultures are equal, because here's the thing.\n[667.12] People will excuse this and go, oh, you know, yeah, cow dog.\n[669.36] First off, there's no there's no evidence that uh it will do anything other than make you smell like cowdung.\n[673.28] Second, you can't make those claims.\n[675.28] You understand that in the United States?\n[676.80] Like you can't, it will cure eczema, and it was starting the age.\n[680.32] Like she just says stuff.\n[681.76] And you can't say in the United States, you have to prove.\n[684.48] And I get it, we have a problem with the FDA, and there's a lot of red tape.\n[687.92] But for people out there who say all cultures are equal.\n[690.24] Do you also think that uh cultures are equal if only some cultures are allowed to make completely unsubstantiated medical claims?\n[696.88] What if someone out there with eczema thinks they're going to fix it with cow crap?\n[701.44] Is this why the trend of bleaching your skin is getting so big in India?\n[705.20] They're putting cow dung all over themselves, and they're like, oh, we gotta bleach that off.\n[708.40] That would make sense.\n[709.52] I like when they finally use soap, it has cow shit in it.\n[712.88] Yes, exactly.\n[714.96] So you can smell the way you want to.\n[716.88] That's right.\n[717.36] That's right.\n[717.84] Look!\n[719.28] Oh boy.\n[721.68] I just don't think that all cultures are equal.\n[723.76] And by that I mean some are bad and they'll remain bad, but it's a new trend.\n[727.76] This is a new trend, selling other cultures to the United States because it's novel, and it's not, or I should say India is not the only culture getting in on the action.\n[736.88] Hey, do you think that bird can't be a healthy hecka product?\n[741.92] Think again.\n[743.60] This is caca de pajaro.\n[745.76] It's made with the finest avocados, cilantro, and bird.\n[750.80] It's a sustainably sourced two in one shampoo and conditioner that will leave your hair feeling silky and smooth.\n[760.16] You look like a million pesos.\n[765.04] That's good luck.\n[766.40] Although he's basically saying you'll look like four dollar.\n[770.24] It's like it's like a thousand bucks.\n[772.64] It sounds impressive.\n[773.68] I don't think so.\n[774.48] Yeah, it is.\n[777.28] I'm gonna guess.\n[777.92] I'm gonna guess 1100.\n[779.04] Hey, great.\n[779.84] What is it?\n[780.40] All right.\n[783.84] 10 grand.\n[784.40] Because I'm American, and this place is better.\n[786.40] Yes, what's the number?\n[787.92] 53,189.\n[790.00] Whoa!\n[791.04] Coming up.\n[791.68] That's the new pay soon.\n[792.88] Hey, bro, you look like 53,489 dollars.\n[797.28] 93 cents.\n[798.16] Don't forget that, bro.\n[799.12] And bro, I round it up.\n[801.28] So get kick off.\n[804.32] Yeah.\n[807.68] Uh I'll tell you who needs to get kicked off the globe.\n[810.80] James Comey.\n[811.68] Well, that's impossible.\n[813.44] And I I this is it's it's funny, it's cringe inducing, and I warn you, this is like over a minute, and it's been cut down from six minutes.\n[822.24] But I remember I've told you this in the past where the left, they just they overuse the term gaslighting.\n[827.04] And the reason they use that is because that's what they do.\n[829.04] So James Comey, first off, he's a Swifty.\n[832.16] Okay.\n[832.48] And he talks about how being a Swifty uh allowed him to stand up to bullies like Donald Trump and gave him the strength.\n[838.64] Here's the thing.\n[839.44] We now know beyond any shadow of a doubt that there was spying on the Trump campaign, right?\n[844.16] That the Russia collusion hoax is just that a hoax.\n[846.96] It was fabricated and it was leaked to the media.\n[848.96] We we we know all of these things.\n[851.44] And he complains and talks about how Donald Trump was the only man who would come after me, and Donald Trump was the only man who I felt the need to record convert because I didn't trust.\n[859.76] What in reality he was part of a fabricated campaign to destroy a man's reputation, his ability to make a living, his family, his legacy.\n[871.12] And I would imagine that President Trump was probably aggressive and aggravated.\n[875.12] Hey, if you were in your workplace and there was an employee who was falsifying emails, pictures to try and get you fired, and to try sending them to your wife.\n[886.40] You were cheating on her, and you knew that it wasn't true, but people were believing it.\n[890.08] Everyone was.\n[890.80] Do you think he'd maybe be mad?\n[892.48] And do you think he'd maybe be a little aggressive with that guy?\n[895.20] And then would that man, James Comey, and this example in this example, would he be entitled to feign outrage and claim victim status?\n[904.24] That's what James Comey has done.\n[906.48] And that's why I believe that James Comey should face serious charges and jail time for his crimes.\n[912.32] But that's not what we're discussing today.\n[913.76] More important is that he's a Swifty, and he's been a fan of her since he was a fully grown man and she was 14.\n[919.60] Donald Trump is still president and still humiliating America on a national stage standing next to Vladimir Putin.\n[926.00] It's like a dream, a bad dream you can't wake up from.\n[929.76] But I don't want to talk about that bad dream this week.\n[931.92] I want to talk about a truly inspirational public figure named Taylor Swift.\n[935.52] This is a hostage.\n[936.56] Taylor Swift, and I go way back.\n[938.88] I went to my first concert of hers 15 years ago.\n[941.76] It was creepy then.\n[942.64] I've been to a second, and I have helped financially support the attendance of a lot of family members at others.\n[949.12] I'm in a family's Swifty group chat.\n[951.76] That's so sad.\n[952.64] I know all her music, and I listened to it in my headphones when I cut the grass.\n[958.88] Although honestly, for me, it's a tie between all too well, 10-minute version and exile, featuring Bonnie Vare.\n[965.92] At every stage of her career, she's shown a certain way of being that resonated with my kids.\n[971.44] Patya Lynn to me as a parent.\n[974.24] And she's still doing that as a grown-up.\n[977.92] Like a lot of you, I struggle with how to stand up to bullies without letting their meanness infect me and change me.\n[990.08] There are far more decent, honest, kind people in America than there are mean jerks.\n[996.56] And don't get me wrong.\n[997.76] We have our jerks, millions of them.\n[999.68] You can have noticed.\n[1000.80] Of course, we need to stand up to jerks and defend what matters.\n[1004.80] But I think we have to try to do that when you're like them.\n[1009.28] Which is what makes me think about Taylor Swift.\n[1012.56] She's made clear that she sees Donald Trump for what he is.\n[1015.92] And last year she urged Americans not to make the serious mistake of electing him.\n[1021.60] Of course, we're now living with the consequences of that mistake, but we know you were involved in a home.\n[1033.44] What's she doing?\n[1035.20] Living her best life.\n[1037.04] Producing great music and as she urged all of us to do during the podcast.\n[1042.00] Why?\n[1042.64] Not giving the jerks power over her mind.\n[1045.36] At my second Taylor Swift concert in Hartford tonight.\n[1050.96] She sang a song about it.\n[1052.80] Why does this exist?\n[1056.40] Why you gotta be so mean?\n[1057.76] And she spoke directly to the nasty people.\n[1060.08] Thank you, Taylor Swift.\n[1062.00] Keep the faith.\n[1063.28] I'm sure she'll take your advice to heart.\n[1066.40] First off, the lack of this reminds me of the you know of office space, Michael Bolton.\n[1071.28] Yeah.\n[1072.24] I celebrate his entire catalog.\n[1074.16] Like it's a joke, and he doesn't realize that it's a joke.\n[1076.16] Also, what you just saw is the problem of feminism personified.\n[1080.56] What do I mean?\n[1081.44] I mean valuing the wrong things.\n[1083.28] I mean valuing nice.\n[1084.48] Hey, Hitler was nice to kids.\n[1085.76] Osama bin Laden was nice to kids.\n[1087.60] You have plenty of horrible people who are nice.\n[1089.36] It's their actions that define them.\n[1091.84] Comey believes he's nice.\n[1093.28] Comey is underhanded, dishonest, and a man of no integrity.\n[1097.20] Who would you rather deal with?\n[1098.16] Someone who's rough around the edges, someone who sends out mean tweets, someone who tells you things that you don't like to hear, but you can count on to be the same person, or somebody who can't be relied upon to pick up your children from school, even if he gives you his word, but he does it with a smile.\n[1114.88] Feminism says nice matters.\n[1117.20] Patriarchy masculinity says that integrity, reliability, dependability, and discipline matters.\n[1125.12] If I have to pick, and Donald Trump is a very flawed man.\n[1127.52] If I have to pick a Donald Trump, or by the way, anyone like uh George Washington or a Jefferson or a Teddy Roosevelt over a Comey or Barack Obama type, I'm going with the strong man who may be a little tougher to deal with every single time.\n[1144.16] Yeah, you know who wasn't nice?\n[1145.36] Winston Churchill.\n[1146.48] That's why he was voted out only a couple years after he helped fight off the axis of evil.\n[1150.00] You know why?\n[1150.40] Because he wasn't nice enough to want socialized health care.\n[1153.92] So it's not a small thing.\n[1155.12] That is feminism personified.\n[1156.96] That is a weak, weak man, and weak men lie, and weak men are untrustworthy.\n[1163.12] And you know who loves weak men?\n[1165.20] Taylor Swift.\n[1166.48] It's clear as day.\n[1167.44] This isn't anything new, by the way.\n[1169.52] So I I don't want to be too harsh on him.\n[1171.44] Plenty of intelligence officials have taken uh cues and great influence from the pop stars of their time.\n[1177.12] Uh who can forget J.\n[1178.00] Edgar Hoover professing his undying love for share.\n[1181.04] Do you believe and of course there was the poorly received Joseph.\n[1180.24] Share.\n[1187.60] And of course, there was the poorly received Joseph McCarthy Ziggy Stardust era.\n[1192.56] This is God.\n[1197.92] And some were a swing and a miss.\n[1200.00] Who can forget the big flop with uh, of course, the head over there, Christopher.\n[1204.88] Uh baby, I was born this Ray.\n[1209.44] Rama Rama.\n[1211.36] The point is gay.\n[1214.32] All right.\n[1216.24] Uh.\n[1217.28] Hey, you know what?\n[1218.48] Uh, you could be a pastor somewhere with that effeminate kind of male thing going on.\n[1224.16] That's I I hate seeing that.\n[1226.16] Listen, it doesn't mean you have to, you know, be some guy that goes out and crushes beers on your skull or something like that.\n[1231.36] No, of course not.\n[1232.40] That's what I'm saying.\n[1233.84] Complaining about bullying when you're the head of the FBI at one point.\n[1237.12] Yeah.\n[1237.52] For four years, you were the head of the FBI and you're complaining about bullying?\n[1240.96] Here's the thing, too.\n[1241.60] That's that's a weird thing.\n[1243.04] It's really easy for them to act nice.\n[1244.48] Right, think about it.\n[1245.12] Everyone thought that Barack Obama was per hey, he's the kind of guy you want to have a beer with.\n[1248.40] By the way, best way to follow me is download the Rumble app, follow me there.\n[1251.28] You'll get this show where live weekdays at 11 a.m.\n[1253.36] Eastern.\n[1253.76] Don't be tied to an algorithm on social media.\n[1256.72] Think about this.\n[1257.36] He accuses Donald Trump of bullying.\n[1259.12] Donald Trump was a, no, wealthy?\n[1261.44] Sure.\n[1261.92] But we all know that wealth doesn't necessarily get you into office, right?\n[1265.04] As seen by spending more money than ever, the uh Kamala Harris campaign.\n[1270.00] Grey Ray, Christopher Ray, Barack Obama, and of course you can sort of add in Hillary Clinton.\n[1275.44] They all took part in a concerted campaign to spy on, destroy the reputation of and leak false information against one man who they didn't like.\n[1286.64] Can you think of any more clear example of bullying than that?\n[1290.24] Right.\n[1290.72] But because Donald Trump said, go screw yourself or whatever.\n[1294.16] We're supposed to believe he's the bully.\n[1295.76] The most powerful people on earth tried to secure their positions of power by as a gang bullying an individual they didn't like who, by the way, was supported by the American public.\n[1308.16] And just to be clear, and I know Ray, the timeline, he's he's gone after that.\n[1312.56] But after Donald Trump did win, they still trumped up a fabricated campaign to delegitimize him, knowing that it was false.\n[1323.28] They were bullying you.\n[1325.04] These people in position when people say it's a big club and you're not in it, they're talking about the Rays, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bidens.\n[1332.00] You understand that they're not talking about the Trumps.\n[1334.00] They're not talking about a real estate agent from New York.\n[1336.48] I can't think of a worse bully and a bully more corrosive to the American fabric.\n[1341.36] You want to know why you don't trust your institutions?\n[1343.36] The left wants to blame you when they want to create a department of misinformation.\n[1346.24] It's Christopher Ray.\n[1348.56] It's Comey.\n[1350.48] That's why you don't trust your institutions.\n[1352.56] And you shouldn't.\n[1354.32] Someone who probably understands where you're coming from.\n[1356.32] Chris Pratt was on Bill Mars uh show.\n[1359.52] Um not the HBO one that people watch, but the one that is entirely uh guest dependent.\n[1365.44] And it's true.\n[1367.92] I will say this.\n[1368.56] You can criticize Chris Pratt there because we all know that he's a uh a a Christian, and I would tend to guess that he leans more conservative, moderate, though he hasn't been super clear about that, but he's very clear about his faith.\n[1379.68] You could uh criticize him for being a fence sitter if you watch the clips, I think in full context, maybe maybe not.\n[1387.04] You could criticize him for being a little milk toast, maybe, but that's not why the left criticizes criticizes him on uh on his appearance on Bill Maher.\n[1396.32] They watched what you're about to watch, and people on the left believe that Chris Pratt is literally Hitler.\n[1402.16] Let's see.\n[1403.04] And in politics, you you inherit enemies.\n[1405.04] And when you jump on in in on, you know, the bandwagon with who is you know the most divisive president ever.\n[1413.12] It makes sense that you're going to be uh made to look terrible.\n[1420.08] And so I don't know what to believe.\n[1421.68] Because I it's not like I sit with Bobby and I go, so hey, let's talk about this.\n[1424.96] Let's talk about it.\n[1425.52] It's like we're just playing cards or playing mafia or having fun or having dinner.\n[1428.48] I'm not gonna pick his brain to find out exactly which of those things are true.\n[1431.04] I just kind of assume that none of them are.\n[1433.12] And for the most part, I wish him well, man.\n[1435.44] I hope that's kind of things that he uh oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way, like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food.\n[1445.04] I think that's a great thing.\n[1446.48] And so just if you just do that, that's amazing.\n[1449.60] I I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be have an allergic reaction to.\n[1457.36] To be like, oh, well, if they do it, I don't want it to happen.\n[1460.32] Um I'll feed my I'll put Clorox in my children's cereal myself.\n[1465.68] Come on, have some be reasonable here.\n[1467.52] There's certain things that would be a good thing to have.\n[1469.04] Uh I want them all to be successful.\n[1471.52] So you may say, like, ah, you know, hey, you could take that a little bit further, Mr.\n[1475.44] Pratt.\n[1476.00] No, I'm not saying that because that's not his job.\n[1478.08] He's an actor.\n[1478.88] Yeah.\n[1480.00] But the left is saying that was that was far enough.\n[1483.36] Did you hear what he said?\n[1484.40] That brings us to Reddit Retards.\n[1491.92] Bang him.\n[1493.28] And just in case you say I'm taking it out of contact.\n[1495.12] Go watch the entire interview.\n[1496.24] It's very similar to that in in tone.\n[1498.32] I would like it if Bill Marr let his guests speak a little more, but that's neither here nor there.\n[1501.60] Well, he was high, so we didn't know.\n[1503.28] So on Reddit, the responses to what you just saw.\n[1505.84] Best animator 182.\n[1508.08] The hatred is extremely reasonable, and Chris Rat.\n[1512.00] I like how they changed the name there.\n[1513.68] Is an idiot.\n[1514.72] There is nothing admirable about policies rooted in eugenics.\n[1520.24] Mentally retarded.\n[1522.00] Well, also no animations there.\n[1524.00] Uh kind of a fake name.\n[1525.84] Yeah.\n[1526.64] Yeah.\n[1526.96] Also, um, I think you might want to do a little bit, uh, a little bit of a uh a background check on eugenics.\n[1533.04] And particularly the history in the uh the 19th and 20th century.\n[1537.28] Not gonna like how it turns up, buttercup Kendall underscore with underscore one underscore L.\n[1543.68] Chris Pratt wants to kill all autistic people.\n[1547.44] Maybe she's retarded.\n[1548.80] No, actually, that was Margaret Sanger.\n[1550.32] Look into Planned Parenthood.\n[1551.52] Wow.\n[1551.84] She gotta change her name to two L's.\n[1553.28] Yeah, he wants to take out red dye from food.\n[1556.08] Or actually, I let me let me really represent Chris Pratt's position uh as accurately as I can.\n[1561.44] He doesn't want to be so mired in hatred that he blindly has to be angry about RFK Jr.\n[1567.52] doing something like removing a notable, a known toxin from children's cereal.\n[1574.16] Contrast that with Margaret Sanger, um, Planned Parenthood specifically wanted to eliminate any and all babies with birth defects.\n[1581.84] And by the way, also most black babies.\n[1584.00] Feisty underscore B 9175.\n[1587.44] What an idiot.\n[1588.72] Not surprising though.\n[1590.16] He is hyper religious and spouts Christian.\n[1593.28] That's corrected from the person who calls him an idiot.\n[1596.48] Bible verses publicly all the time.\n[1598.96] I put him up there, were I think with the other nut job has been actors like Dean Kane, Kevin Sorbo, and Jenny McCarthy.\n[1608.88] McCarthy.\n[1612.96] I've spent enough I've spent quite a bit of time with Dean Kane and Kevin Sorbo has been on the show.\n[1616.56] Uh I I know for certain that uh Dean Kane knows how to spell with.\n[1621.68] I mean, we can try.\n[1622.96] They were literally shaking typing on the comics at is it AI or Al.\n[1628.16] Some of us are old enough to remember the MAGA GOP hissy fits when Michelle Obama promoted healthier eating habits as first lady.\n[1635.28] Wonder what this Pratt had to say about that.\n[1638.32] I hate being retarded.\n[1639.84] Here's the thing.\n[1640.88] No one has a problem with somebody telling you to be healthier.\n[1644.80] The Michelle Obama campaign, right?\n[1647.76] The healthier school lunches were a complete failure again because it was predicated on the uh the idea that government could fix everything.\n[1653.12] The lunches were expensive, they were gross.\n[1655.20] Kids refused to eat them, so they just ended up trading them for other goodies and treats.\n[1659.36] It increased it waste.\n[1660.88] Kids were still hungry because they wouldn't eat the lunches.\n[1663.20] And by the way, it's at the same time as Barack Obama eliminated the presidential fitness test.\n[1667.28] So if you're going to say, hey, everyone, let's move more, let's be healthier.\n[1671.84] Great.\n[1672.40] Don't combine that with all body types are just as beautiful and healthy.\n[1676.08] And don't eliminate the presidential fitness test.\n[1678.08] It was about making people feel good no matter what they did, as opposed to being based on results.\n[1682.80] Also, the issue there is that she wasn't president and we're tired of the first lady's stupid pet projects.\n[1690.40] She's gonna stay busy.\n[1691.76] Yeah.\n[1692.88] The healthy school lunch program, just to be clear, it was about as successful and gross as Mexico's school lunch program.\n[1703.60] Muy delicioso.\n[1707.52] This has been Reddit Retards.\n[1716.64] Gerald, plug the merch store before we get to the blacks.\n[1719.20] Go to Crattershop.com right now to get this shirt, not the one that I was wearing a minute ago.\n[1723.36] There's only two genders or pro gun or pro cow poop.\n[1727.28] I don't think we have a pro cow poop.\n[1728.56] No, I'm very anti.\n[1729.68] Probably find one as a general rule.\n[1731.60] I don't know.\n[1731.92] We'll see.\n[1732.32] Pro dung.\n[1732.96] Yeah.\n[1733.36] Crowder shop.com.\n[1734.32] Find something cool.\n[1734.96] Good word, by the way.\n[1736.40] We had one employee here who literally smelled like cow poop.\n[1739.12] Really?\n[1739.60] Yeah, it was short-lived.\n[1740.56] Oh, we don't know.\n[1741.36] You know, you remember.\n[1743.36] So I don't want to get into too much detail.\n[1748.00] Uh it was I will tell you this.\n[1750.48] Look, look, for as much as people like love to bitch about the boss, we had to have meetings on how to approach uh a person who smelled so bad that other employees were complaining without hurting their feelings or sort of stepping on a legal liability landmine.\n[1766.00] Do you have any idea how difficult that is?\n[1767.92] When you have a you have employees threatening to quit because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.04] Yes.\n[1770.24] Because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.12] Yes.\n[1779.52] How about uh you start a prank war.\n[1781.04] Uh-huh.\n[1781.52] Tell them what's a prank war, and then they're the only one that gets pranked.\n[1784.32] And it's like they walk through a door and you know, soap falls on it.\n[1788.08] Yes.\n[1788.32] So they hit a tripwire as they walk by their desk, and then Fabrizio just goes.\n[1794.24] Yes, exactly.\n[1795.20] They behind a door and it's just a tool chest.\n[1797.20] Like, what was that?\n[1798.00] It was the sound of 5,000 bars of ivory coming down to stairs.\n[1802.96] I prayed to you.\n[1803.92] I covered your seat in dryer sheets.\n[1806.16] Yeah.\n[1807.36] It was uncomfortable.\n[1808.72] Speaking of uncomfortable.\n[1810.64] Guys, I did take a shower.\n[1812.88] So uh let me ask you this.\n[1814.64] Can you identify, and I'm not talking about talking heads.\n[1817.12] I'm not talking about people who are uh just in the space where they they revolve around political commentary.\n[1821.76] Can you identify a major black celebrity who's conservative?\n[1826.88] I heard Denzel Washington.\n[1828.72] Uh no, he's he's he's voted Democrat, he's a Christian, and he encourages accountability, but doesn't fully connect the dots.\n[1834.48] And by the way, I from everything that I've seen and heard like Denzel Washington, we probably would disagree on some issues politically.\n[1841.04] Uh another question for you do you think there's ever going to be a point where the scales tip?\n[1846.88] Because we saw it with Hispanic votes.\n[1848.48] We saw it with Gen Z.\n[1849.68] We've never seen it to a significant degree with black votes in America.\n[1852.64] And we have more black representatives or commentators uh than ever.\n[1857.52] You know, back when we were growing up, you pretty much had Thomas Sowell and kind of Larry Elder.\n[1861.84] Um Alan Keyes, Herman King Alfonso Rachel was an early and OG.\n[1865.76] I'd recommend go checking him out on YouTube.\n[1867.44] He was one of the first people there.\n[1868.72] But now you have a ton of people.\n[1870.16] The Blexit never really materialized.\n[1872.80] Do you think that it'll ever happen?\n[1875.36] Comment.\n[1877.68] And uh I I also understand why it's so um it's so tipped uh towards one side uh as far as politically with black people, because if you look or listen to anything in media, um, you will only see black celebrities assuming that you must be.\n[1900.16] You must be, unless you're a traitor, uh, liberal if you're black.\n[1905.92] We are voting for the right to choose what happens to our own bodies.\n[1912.64] We are damn black bitch.\n[1914.96] I choose you ourselves from this precipice of danger.\n[1920.40] Well, I misspelled respect.\n[1922.64] And a lot of these cake corrected me in a hashtag.\n[1929.36] Now I want y'all to help me correct President Trump to teach him what it means.\n[1934.48] Ladies and gentlemen, please.\n[1937.04] Nice haircut.\n[1937.92] Big loud Texas, welcome to the next president of the United States.\n[1945.28] Come on.\n[1946.80] You think that this guy has done stuff for black people.\n[1951.84] All I gotta say is crack is whack.\n[1955.84] I'm not trying to be funny.\n[1957.52] Well, mission accomplished.\n[1958.88] Nothing has never done enough for black folks.\n[1961.60] Thank you for all that.\n[1962.32] It's a double negative.\n[1963.12] That means he's done something.\n[1964.08] I know you guys are excited to see her.\n[1965.60] I didn't know you guys would be excited to see me too.\n[1967.60] But uh Yeah.\n[1969.68] I gotta go disappear to what I call training camp for a few weeks, come back with a bolts butt and ten new pounds of muscle.\n[1975.20] Now this brings us to uh the uh I keep wanting to say outnumbered, the surrounded, which for those of you who are unfamiliar, it's basically change my mind with a vote timer.\n[1986.88] Um it is, it really is.\n[1989.60] And this is one black radical.\n[1992.08] This is uh an actress, Amanda Seals, uh, versus 20 black um conservatives.\n[1997.44] Now, here's the thing.\n[1998.08] I w uh we're going to get into some of the claims versus the reality.\n[2002.48] Um, but this is important to to note, it's a technique that's used a lot.\n[2007.28] And I've encountered it in Change My Mind quite a bit.\n[2009.60] And right, Change My Mind was just sit down, establish uh the premise, which they refer to as a prompt, and anyone can sit down and you know, change your mind.\n[2018.88] Okay.\n[2019.76] You've seen people do this where what they do is the in betweens.\n[2023.04] If they know their argument doesn't really hold any water, they try and taint it with things like, you know, oh, you're unreasonable, or ugh, I can't believe these people must be paid actors.\n[2033.20] Or ugh, they try if their argument doesn't hold water, they try and tip those scales on a it's performance art.\n[2040.16] So as bad as you thought this was going to be with Amanda Seals, it's much worse.\n[2045.36] I'm not sure where your education came from, but they lied to you.\n[2048.80] I hope some of y'all are acting.\n[2050.40] I really do.\n[2051.68] I knew I was gonna be surrounded by ignorance, but damn, let's go.\n[2054.96] And my points are just as valid as yours, even though you got a pocket square and a church of Christ uh pin on your chest.\n[2061.28] Whatever.\n[2061.92] It's a cross, same difference.\n[2063.12] You got an American flag and you think you know something because you a cop.\n[2065.60] And ultimately not a cop, this much of it.\n[2067.60] It's a it's a cab all day over here.\n[2069.36] So let me make that clear.\n[2071.76] But you're literally speaking this.\n[2073.28] And you're not going to do that with me either.\n[2074.56] So you're stating your point.\n[2076.08] Y'all just want to be seen.\n[2077.44] I don't need to be seen.\n[2078.40] You're coming.\n[2078.96] That's why you're dressed like a poison dart frog.\n[2082.08] Just like she fell in the four buckets of the chimney or not.\n[2084.48] I have not had, you know, first of all, you're a light skin woman.\n[2087.84] So are you?\n[2088.48] Yes, and you're doing great cell.\n[2090.96] Yes, and so colorism really does serve us.\n[2094.00] This is scary.\n[2095.04] You need to think about me as your mama.\n[2096.88] Do not talk to me in that fashion.\n[2098.48] So let's check that now.\n[2100.16] See, and this is what happens too.\n[2101.68] Sometimes I refer to tone policing, but she's telling some, you need to do this.\n[2106.72] Now, I don't mean it's it's very reasonable to require someone if you are offering them respect to be respectful.\n[2112.48] Like, hey, I didn't, and I've done this.\n[2114.00] Hey, you know, I let you finish.\n[2115.36] Yeah.\n[2115.68] Uh you gotta let me finish.\n[2117.76] Or occasionally I'll go, you know what?\n[2119.76] I'm going to finish uh my thought as though you're an adult capable of giving the same respect I've given you.\n[2125.92] But that's not what she's doing.\n[2126.80] She's like, you need to think of me like yo mama.\n[2129.76] How entitled can you be?\n[2131.84] You don't get to tell someone what to think or how they should view you.\n[2135.20] Here's how someone's going to view you, usually.\n[2137.60] It's usually going to be based on your actions.\n[2141.20] And in this case, your words, your stupid, stupid words.\n[2145.84] So seals, just to give you an idea, was at the center of quite a few uh controversies herself.\n[2151.28] For example, defending Jesse Smollett, quote, even if it was a hoax.\n[2155.68] What?\n[2156.24] Yeah, this is someone who just if black people can do no wrong.\n[2159.92] Even if it was a hoax and cost taxpayer dollars in the and the city, and even if it did stir racial division and hatred, you know, another hoax too, like Michael Brown, hands up, don't shoot.\n[2169.68] Jesse Smallett's funny.\n[2171.04] Black lives matter, the terrorism, the billions of dollars in damage.\n[2174.00] That was also a hoax.\n[2176.00] So she was also kicked out of a black Emmy party.\n[2178.40] She got into a feud with a black sorority, and she claimed that she was autistic without ever actually being diagnosed, which is funny, but hey, it's not just black white.\n[2186.64] That's feminism to the letter.\n[2188.80] Just claim victim status, and you assume you win the argument, but that doesn't fly here.\n[2193.84] It's time for claim truth.\n[2199.44] Can we go back claiming autism as a tool in an argument?\n[2204.24] That's real retarded, sir.\n[2205.60] Sure.\n[2206.00] Yeah, it's a it's a it's a thing that a lot of people do.\n[2208.64] Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n[2209.92] The only person who never will is Al Sharpton who spells respect with two K's.\n[2215.36] Respect.\n[2216.32] I misspell respect.\n[2217.60] It's crazy.\n[2218.16] That was actually very revealing.\n[2219.20] Because to me, I just thought it's the way he speaks.\n[2220.88] No, in his mind, he's going, R E S P E KK, that is what it means to me.\n[2226.32] Yeah, there's a whole song.\n[2228.32] I don't know.\n[2229.28] I don't think I would ever get to the point in an argument where I'm like, but I'm retarded.\n[2233.04] Yeah.\n[2233.76] Well, you don't need to say it.\n[2234.72] I don't think you said in an argument, I think she was just claiming it.\n[2236.80] She's claiming it.\n[2237.52] Yeah, but why?\n[2238.24] Anyway.\n[2238.80] Because it's a status symbol to say.\n[2240.32] It's a victim.\n[2241.28] It is.\n[2241.60] It's like I'm a marginalized group.\n[2244.64] I'm I'm not only am I black, but I'm also a woman.\n[2247.20] And not only that, but I'm on the lowest end possible of being retarded.\n[2250.96] Yeah.\n[2251.20] No, no, no.\n[2251.68] I don't know.\n[2252.08] I I get it, but then you try to put yourself out there as somebody who can articulate the points of why reparations are a thing.\n[2258.00] Like you've basically just under, oh, so I don't need to listen to you.\n[2261.12] No, no, no.\n[2261.76] I understand you're being logical.\n[2262.96] That's your problem.\n[2263.84] Is if you take away victim status.\n[2265.76] Right.\n[2266.16] If you completely remove it.\n[2267.04] Okay.\n[2267.28] In other words, if you don't go, wait, black, white, okay, well, hold on a second, um, white woman, black guy, what uh trans, okay, disabled.\n[2274.00] Right.\n[2274.32] If you take all of that away, you actually have to um rest on the the validity of your arguments.\n[2282.16] Your actual thoughts.\n[2283.20] Yeah.\n[2283.52] Your opinions.\n[2284.16] So if you take all of the identity politics away, it just comes down to actions, performance, arguments, claims.\n[2293.28] We can't have that, and we certainly don't have that in the public school system.\n[2296.32] So the first claim uh that's made systemic ra and this has been addressed in changed my mind well over half a decade ago.\n[2306.08] Actually, systemic racism, by the way, challenge is still out there of one example today in the 21st century.\n[2311.04] Systemic racism is real, says the self-diagnosed retard.\n[2314.96] Ultimately, systemic racism exists in our institutions on a government level in our institutions, whether it's prisons or schools, and it is undeniable because they are actively trying to reinstate it right now.\n[2329.44] Okay.\n[2330.08] So the truth, it's hard to deal with claims that make no sense.\n[2334.72] I don't know what you mean by trying to reinstate it.\n[2336.40] And I watched the whole thing, and it still doesn't make sense.\n[2338.48] Uh blacks are completely proportionally represented in Congress, right?\n[2341.52] In government, okay, about 14%.\n[2343.68] And uh, as far as prison, now again, her premise, but again, she's she's on the spectrum according to her, is just black people are being put there because they're black.\n[2351.52] Black people in this country, despite making up twelve to thirteen percent of the population commit over half of all the violent crimes.\n[2358.08] And then if you look at wait systemic discrimination, okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students.\n[2360.00] Okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students who are woefully underqualified in some cases, they do.\n[2373.92] They do get in.\n[2374.72] DEI exists.\n[2377.20] And here's the thing, too.\n[2378.08] When she goes on to talk about reparations, they act as though those things have never taken place.\n[2383.12] DEI is reparational.\n[2384.40] Affirmative action is reparations.\n[2385.76] Model Cities program is reparations.\n[2387.92] EBT, SNAP, the baby mama that was created by these are reparations.\n[2391.68] Section 8 housing, more money into public school.\n[2394.32] These are reparations that have been paid to the tune of trillions of dollars and have made nothing better.\n[2400.64] Now she may say those aren't the reparations we want, but those are the reparations that exist because it's what their party and what their community, the black community, have demanded.\n[2408.96] They petitioned, they got these reparations, and it didn't work.\n[2415.04] The answer, if you ask them, so when is it enough is always more.\n[2419.60] Here's the next claim that she makes.\n[2423.12] And this is a tough one.\n[2424.24] I don't even know.\n[2424.88] It's like grabbing a bar of soap.\n[2426.64] Uh soap.\n[2428.08] Which kind of soap, yeah.\n[2429.52] Done so.\n[2430.56] Harriet Tubman was uh actually aided by white supremacy something.\n[2436.40] I refuse to embrace a victim mentality because that's not what our grandparents and Harriet Tugman and those people fall for.\n[2442.96] They fought for whatever.\n[2444.00] Do not bring that Harriet Tubman's name in vain, baby.\n[2447.52] Please name in vain.\n[2451.20] Harriet Tubman was literally, literally saving her family and others from slavery.\n[2460.00] Yeah.\n[2460.80] You know who helped her white people.\n[2462.64] You know who helped her.\n[2463.68] They were on the underground railroad.\n[2465.04] No, no, no, no, you know, helped her.\n[2466.96] Come on, even though you know who helped her?\n[2469.44] Guy.\n[2470.16] And there are people who benefit from white supremacy.\n[2473.36] What?\n[2474.40] That guy had answers.\n[2475.60] Yeah, he did.\n[2476.64] He did.\n[2477.52] Uh, okay, so the truth to this one.\n[2481.52] I uh uh okay.\n[2483.76] So here's my understanding of her uh of her uh again, self-diagnosed uh autistic argument is that um white people helped Harriet Tubman, but they could only help her because they were beneficiaries of white supremacy, therefore white supremacy helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2499.60] Okay, so you don't want allies.\n[2502.48] Get it done with 12% of the population.\n[2505.44] I would help, but I benefit from white supremacy.\n[2508.40] Everyone in this room, by the way, you're precluded from helping because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2512.40] Tell that to the Quaker Church who helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2515.20] Yeah.\n[2515.76] Tell it to Massachusetts Governor uh John Andrew.\n[2518.96] Tell it to the multiple whites who helped with the underground railroad specifically, just to be clear.\n[2524.56] No, no, no, you guys all have to stop because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2528.56] Oh, so the slaves should do it on their own.\n[2531.04] This is a way of removing any and all credit for the good deeds that white people have committed.\n[2538.00] In the name of I know this is inconvenient.\n[2540.32] Modern Christianom.\n[2541.76] Yeah.\n[2542.40] I don't understand what what this point like if you didn't have white people, nobody would know about Harriet Tubman.\n[2548.08] You know why?\n[2549.04] She wouldn't have made it.\n[2550.08] We wouldn't let you write books about it, and you wouldn't be free.\n[2553.04] Mm-hmm.\n[2553.84] So maybe just saying thank you.\n[2556.24] You know who else is the benefit uh who's benefited from white supremacy?\n[2559.52] Um, the wealthiest celebrities on earth.\n[2561.92] There you go.\n[2562.48] Beyonce, NJZ, the top box office draws of the night, the uh Will Smith of the world, the Denzel Washington's of the world, the three most recognizable faces on earth in the 90s, Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson, kind of, that's a half one, Mike Tyson.\n[2576.08] Because white people you know who else?\n[2577.44] Barack Obama, president of the United States.\n[2579.28] I know that one's pretty crazy.\n[2580.72] That's rough.\n[2581.44] Also, white people, the ones who've given you the platform to speak these kinds of asinine opinions uh in a show like surrounded, not outnumbered.\n[2592.00] Surrounded.\n[2592.56] The next claim that she makes.\n[2595.28] That blacks absolutely do need reparations, and she's gonna make an airtight case.\n[2600.24] Now, let me land the plane.\n[2601.52] We're talking about reparations, and what you're doing is actually female pilot.\n[2606.32] The fact is reparations are just and necessary because on a basic level, black people built this country, and the country continues to thrive off of the labor that black people put into this country, and it would behoove you, young man, to really understand the way that your ancestors put blood, sweat, and tears into this nation that is still living off of those blood, sweat and tears.\n[2628.80] Okay, and I'll open this up to you guys, but here's the truth.\n[2630.72] All right, couple of things.\n[2631.76] I just addressed this, right?\n[2632.88] When you talk about EBT snap, section eight housing, more money to public schools, when you talk about affirmative action, DEI.\n[2638.32] These are all forms of reparations, to be clear.\n[2640.88] I think at some point she says repatriations.\n[2642.56] I'm not entirely sure she kind of delineates between the two.\n[2644.80] Remunerations.\n[2645.52] Is that what she says?\n[2646.08] Yeah, remunerations, sorry.\n[2647.36] Renumerations.\n[2648.48] Um.\n[2651.04] And she'll say, well, that's not what now we're asking for money.\n[2653.52] Okay, great, but those things exist because your community and the Democrat Party said that those were required.\n[2660.40] Okay?\n[2661.04] Those were required.\n[2662.00] That's the rep to the tune of trillions of dollars.\n[2664.88] Why is that not enough?\n[2666.16] And by the way, why do reparations need to be paid to a 15-year-old black guy?\n[2672.24] What kind of reparations does Jesse Smallett deserve?\n[2675.12] And is it wiped out by what he costs the good good taxpaying citizens of Chicago?\n[2680.96] I know you say you should defend him anyway because it's just a hoax.\n[2683.68] Oh, that's right.\n[2684.40] Now I'm getting it.\n[2685.44] The answer is always more money, please, more money, please.\n[2688.88] You asked for reparations.\n[2691.28] You may not like them now.\n[2692.56] It's what you asked for.\n[2694.64] You got them.\n[2696.64] You're saying it's not enough.\n[2698.88] Now you're on your own.\n[2700.40] The other thing is, by the way, I'm so tired of this.\n[2702.96] All references available, link in the descriptions.\n[2705.60] Um blacks built this country.\n[2708.08] No, they didn't.\n[2709.44] No, they didn't.\n[2710.64] In comparison to the labor in this country, and certainly in comparison to the businesses created and the innovations uh in this country, and yes, manual labor, especially if you look at the industrial revolution.\n[2722.48] You look at these great booms that took place in this country.\n[2725.28] It is not because of black people.\n[2728.56] They took part in it, but not any greater part than any well.\n[2732.72] 75%, by the way, of Southerners didn't own any slaves whatsoever.\n[2735.76] States like California never had any slaves, to be clear.\n[2738.96] And while we're talking about this, the vast majority of slaves, anywhere from 90% to 96%, I think the high number, 96% comes from Cornell West.\n[2747.68] Uh, they were sold into slavery by West African slave traders.\n[2752.40] Also, if you want to go buy yourself a slave today, you can still do it in plenty of African nations.\n[2757.76] You're gonna be dealing with a black person, though, so don't be surprised.\n[2761.36] Here's the next part of this is um slavery, too, actually can be argued through the metrics, it held the country back.\n[2770.00] The free North outperformed the South while they still had slaves in every way you could measure economically.\n[2778.08] The cotton industry exploded after slavery ended.\n[2781.52] Innovations like the cotton gin that came from the areas of the country that didn't have slavery.\n[2786.08] So this is something, and it's something that used to it's used to guilt white people.\n[2789.76] You wouldn't have this country if not for black people.\n[2792.08] Okay, well, black people, Africans who were sold by their African brothers.\n[2796.56] Hey, they're still there in countries in Africa.\n[2799.36] What does that look like?\n[2801.84] What's the difference?\n[2804.00] You have Africans and both.\n[2806.40] They're slaves in both.\n[2808.96] Slavery's wrong, to be clear, just like Hitler, bad.\n[2811.92] Africans in both slavery and slave owners alike in both.\n[2816.24] Pick a country, any country.\n[2818.64] The African continent, United States.\n[2820.56] What's the difference?\n[2821.52] Who built the country?\n[2824.08] One of the most infuriating things that she does is she makes these claims as though they're self-evident, right?\n[2829.20] She just says, yes, systemic racism exists.\n[2831.52] We were trying to think about, okay, well, how do you combat that without going down 50 rabbit holes?\n[2835.28] Okay, we'll go with what she said.\n[2836.40] Government prisons and schools.\n[2837.60] Okay, well, you can't prove that because we just disproved that.\n[2840.32] Reparations are absolutely just and needed.\n[2842.64] Okay, well, how do you prove that?\n[2844.08] Who gets it?\n[2845.04] Right.\n[2845.60] These people, we built this country, therefore, she goes to the next point as though that foundational statement is true.\n[2852.00] I just wish she would say something with some kind of factual backing.\n[2856.40] Quote a study, even if I don't agree with it, just something, a stat.\n[2860.00] Give me a number to go after.\n[2861.76] In fact, when the guy brought up statistics about black on black crime, she goes, stats lie all the time, honey.\n[2867.20] If you're gonna make your argument about stats, you already lost.\n[2870.08] Yeah.\n[2870.48] It's exactly what she did.\n[2871.44] It's like, oh, so I will never ever, you're just a racist person.\n[2874.64] Yeah.\n[2874.96] That's really what we're dealing with.\n[2876.08] They're a racist person who hates this country.\n[2878.24] Fantastic.\n[2878.88] Here's an offer from me.\n[2880.48] Not this show, from me personally.\n[2882.24] I will write you a check right now to pay to have you move to Africa.\n[2885.28] Let me Because apparently you don't like it here.\n[2887.20] Yeah.\n[2887.52] Let me ask you.\n[2888.08] I don't want to be, I don't want to be an oppressor.\n[2889.60] No, no, none of us do.\n[2890.48] Let me ask you this.\n[2891.04] If you went to Harriet Tubman back in time and said, hey, look, you can you can tomorrow, slavery is done.\n[2897.28] You don't have to do this railroad stuff.\n[2898.96] Okay, it's done.\n[2900.08] It's over.\n[2900.72] This railroad stuff.\n[2901.60] Everyone will be free.\n[2902.72] Everyone will be free.\n[2903.76] Oh, that's malarkey.\n[2905.04] But that's it.\n[2905.52] It's a fresh start.\n[2906.24] The only way we know how to do this, Miss Tubman, you've inspired us, is to break these chains.\n[2910.88] Slavery is done, but we just got to get a fresh start.\n[2912.80] We can't keep looking to the past.\n[2914.00] It's over.\n[2914.48] Everyone's free.\n[2915.68] Do you think of course she would take that deal.\n[2917.76] And if she saw seal, she would tell her to get a haircut and sew up the holes in her genes.\n[2921.60] Here's a bonus claim that she makes that uh just sort of shows that she's an actual racist.\n[2927.04] If you didn't know that by her defending Jesse Smollett because of his blackness, uh the claim here is that the Chinese aren't actual minorities or something like black people.\n[2936.32] I don't know.\n[2936.96] For example, we have the uh Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n[2939.68] We prevented Chinese people from getting citizenship and even entering the country, we discriminate against them, and basically put them under apartheid, even here in the United States.\n[2947.68] Yet they have the highest median household income.\n[2949.52] How is that possible?\n[2950.56] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to pay for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time?\n[2957.20] Which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2950.64] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to beg for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time, which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2960.32] Oh, young Matt.\n[2961.60] One, comparing Chinese people who are immigrants that made a choice to come to the United States and comparing the continued effort of black people to ground themselves in a nation that continues to make impediments for them to show and live and exist in their true citizenship is a false equivalency.\n[2979.28] I don't believe that happens at all.\n[2980.24] What a what no one here is in the world?\n[2982.16] Are you acting right now?\n[2983.12] Do you really believe that?\n[2984.80] There's a way to try and discredit the person.\n[2986.88] Yeah.\n[2987.60] Now, before I get to the truth, let me just tell you this.\n[2989.68] I'm also, I think that you're placating by saying black people kill black people in record numbers.\n[2994.80] Because that's a you know what I'm actually really concerned with?\n[2997.92] I'm also really concerned with the fact that black people kill white people in this country in record numbers.\n[3002.40] It's not just your community's problem.\n[3004.64] No.\n[3005.28] And we have a right to an opinion because we are several times more likely to be assaulted, to be mugged, to be robbed, or to be killed by a black person as a white American than by a white American.\n[3015.20] Yep, the numbers are even higher because of the proximity effect of black people living around other black people.\n[3020.08] But let's be honest about this.\n[3022.40] We're concerned that we're more likely to be the victim of crime, and you can't blame it on there not being enough affirmative action.\n[3030.80] Anyone want to c anyone agree with that?\n[3032.64] I'm tired of going, oh, the black on black crime, they're the biggest yeah, sure, they're the biggest threat to the black community.\n[3037.44] I'm very concerned with them being a threat, that community to my white children.\n[3042.00] Got it.\n[3042.64] That's a great point because in this the the longer version of the video, you know, other people brought that up.\n[3049.04] And it is a real concern.\n[3050.40] But she her response was uh, well, how many how many black people do you see uh in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3056.32] A lot.\n[3056.64] How many white people do you see in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3058.96] Uh some.\n[3059.76] Well, uh that well, then that's not that's why.\n[3061.60] That's you're not you're not in danger from white people because you don't see white people.\n[3064.48] Yeah, yeah.\n[3065.12] The only problem is if you look at the armed robbery, you look at the burglaries, you look at the violent crime taking place in the white neighborhoods, you know, the next town over, you still see the same stats.\n[3075.20] In other words, these gangs of largely black people, they travel.\n[3080.08] And we have a problem with it.\n[3081.52] Brown round get around, they get around.\n[3084.24] The browns, browns, browns, browns, they get around.\n[3088.24] Shh.\n[3090.48] But here's the truth.\n[3091.84] Uh the Chinese in the United States.\n[3094.32] It's not a false equivalent.\n[3095.36] See, they weren't even considered citizens until 1943.\n[3098.24] 1870.\n[3099.44] Wow.\n[3099.76] Is when the 15th Amendment gave black men the right to vote, to be clear.\n[3104.16] 1920, the 19th Amendment, some would say a mistake granted black women the right to vote.\n[3109.12] Not because they're black, all women.\n[3110.88] And uh today, yes, the median income for Chinese Americans is 82,000 versus 54,000 for black Americans.\n[3117.68] So they've been discriminated against far more recently, in a way that would negatively affect their income.\n[3121.92] They bounce back.\n[3123.36] And by the way, richer than the average German, just to be clear.\n[3126.72] Like the Chinese do really well.\n[3128.72] You keep saying it wrong.\n[3130.08] The Chinese.\n[3130.88] Thanks.\n[3131.20] Sorry, it's pronounced Chinese.\n[3132.48] Finally admonish me.\n[3133.60] Yes.\n[3133.92] Admonish him alone.\n[3134.88] I don't want to be ethnocentric.\n[3136.72] Do it a lot.\n[3138.64] Chinese go down with the ship, Jim.\n[3141.04] And by the way, these metrics show you uh they Chinese, they know dumb.\n[3143.84] They are doing very well.\n[3146.48] So I don't know why it's plural in other countries, but it is.\n[3148.72] Hey, so what let's let's just concede the argument that she makes right now.\n[3152.16] I just want to concede every single point, right?\n[3153.84] I know we don't want to do that, but let's just concede.\n[3155.68] Every single thing you say about white people in this country, white supremacists and Harriet Tubman, systemic racism everywhere.\n[3162.00] You're right, you're owed every single dollar in my bank account.\n[3165.04] Do you think that's going to happen?\n[3167.76] And is that the best advice for all of your constituents to try to get that?\n[3172.72] Or let's just say that they're an oppressive system that they can never get out of, which is kind of what you're claiming in the first place.\n[3178.08] Wouldn't it be better to do what the other cultures have done and just try to make the very best of it that you possibly can and try to fix that instead of just complaining and shaking your fist at the sky and saying every bad thing that happens to you is because of the white man keeping you down?\n[3191.60] That's what works.\n[3192.88] You don't care about your community.\n[3194.48] Yeah.\n[3194.80] You care about having a grievance.\n[3196.40] You care about having an excuse for failure.\n[3199.60] Right.\n[3200.24] Instead of saying, hey, we need more fathers in the home in this community.\n[3204.16] Hey, we need less violence in this community.\n[3206.00] Hey, we need better education in this community.\n[3208.08] And guess what?\n[3208.96] Those people aren't gonna give it to us.\n[3210.64] Fine.\n[3211.12] We're gonna do it ourselves.\n[3212.32] Yeah.\n[3212.72] I tell you who really wants preparations.\n[3215.20] Chrysler.\n[3216.24] Oh, I thought you said pre I thought you said preparations, and I was thinking it's big H.\n[3220.48] No.\n[3221.36] No.\n[3221.84] Reparations.\n[3223.44] I'm not gonna say it.\n[3224.16] And by the way, bring up a bonus uh for uh those who are members of Rumble Premium for Mug Club.\n[3228.16] By the way, if you're not click that button below, we'll go on for another hour.\n[3231.44] Uh it's 99 dollars, you get everything ad-free, you get 100% more show, including the Friday show, and uh it's the only thing that keeps the lights on, or try for 999 a month, where they talked about with her uh black culture, and they talked about hip hop and the things that were glorified, and she said, Well, who's the one feeding black people that?\n[3248.48] Who's the one so if if they're force feeding you junk food, and in other words, it's white people who are largely responsible for the mass consumption in the black community and rejection by the way of any and all other forms of media as it relates to gangster culture as it relates to decadence and hedonism that you see.\n[3267.84] Um, I would have loved to ask her, what's on your playlist?\n[3271.36] Yeah.\n[3272.48] What do you think's on Jesse Smollett's playlist?\n[3274.80] Why have you been dubbed duped by the evil white man?\n[3278.08] I'm guessing Jew, right?\n[3279.36] Why have you been duped?\n[3281.68] It is our fault.\n[3282.56] Yeah.\n[3282.88] We men of the bucket and the mop.\n[3284.64] Yes.\n[3285.28] Yes.\n[3286.16] Yeah.\n[3286.88] It's uh, which is after which she modeled her hairdo.\n[3290.16] Um was the other thing.\n[3292.00] Do we have a do we have a left versus reality stinger, or is it a claim truth?\n[3296.64] Uh left.\n[3298.00] We don't have any stinger for this one.\n[3299.36] Oh we just have left versus things.\n[3301.20] Yeah.\n[3301.44] I can claim truth again, but really.\n[3307.20] You know, he's been making the rounds.\n[3308.72] He's been making a lot of progress.\n[3310.56] And yesterday, he met with some of the uh some people say Euro trash.\n[3315.52] I would never say that.\n[3316.24] Leaders in DC.\n[3317.84] And it all started off before we get to some of the claims from the left where they really want this administration to fail.\n[3324.32] And by that I mean they really want never-ending war.\n[3327.44] Um, it all kicked off with a warm welcome to Zelensky who put on a suit, sort of.\n[3333.60] I guess he got the message.\n[3347.76] Trump is on your message for the people of Ukraine.\n[3350.00] We're all right.\n[3351.76] We love them.\n[3353.04] We love them.\n[3360.48] Thank you very much, everybody goes.\n[3362.88] Couple of things there.\n[3363.92] First off, when he goes, this is the best I have, this suit, change it.\n[3368.24] That's why we think you're a disrespectful little prick.\n[3371.04] Stop by men's warehouse, get a two for one.\n[3375.12] And I look, look, this is the thing too.\n[3376.88] It's funny, right?\n[3377.52] Where people are talking about all cultures, hey, hey.\n[3380.40] It's a custom here.\n[3382.16] It just so happens to be a custom on the greatest country on earth.\n[3386.56] Put on a fucking suit.\n[3389.12] President Trump also, it's not a big deal.\n[3391.60] It's just respect our culture.\n[3393.44] You know.\n[3394.40] President Trump also, uh, by the way, was in rare form.\n[3397.12] Uh he had personalized greetings for each, I would never say Euro Trash leader.\n[3401.84] Everyone knows President Macron of France, who's been with me from the beginning, one of the first people I met as a foreign dignitary, and uh I like them from day one.\n[3414.88] And I like him even more now.\n[3416.56] That's pretty good.\n[3417.44] That's unusual.\n[3419.12] That's a pretty unusual thing.\n[3421.20] Prime Minister Maloney of Italy, who's a uh really great leader and an inspiration over there.\n[3427.84] She's uh she's served now, even though she's a very young person, she's served there for a long period of time relative to others.\n[3435.04] They don't they don't last very long.\n[3436.72] You've lasted a long time.\n[3438.40] You're gonna be there a long time.\n[3439.92] Chancellor Mertz of Germany, who is uh just put your Biden in this role person, right?\n[3446.48] And a very strong leader and very highly respected, and he's my friend, and it's another friend.\n[3453.28] Thank you very much.\n[3457.60] I want to I want to get a 10 like that.\n[3460.48] Where'd you get it?\n[3461.36] I get mine from a machine.\n[3464.24] I stand and go, whoa.\n[3466.32] Here's the thing.\n[3467.04] You may not like it, but the guy has something to offer in basic communications.\n[3473.20] Like well, but they got people to to laugh.\n[3475.12] You're there for a very serious subject.\n[3476.64] You compliment people, you got them laughing.\n[3478.96] He understands how to work a room.\n[3481.04] Well, one of the biggest lies that we were ever told, and they still try and sell is you know, we're being mocked, we're being uh we're we're the laughing stock of the international stage.\n[3489.12] Comment below.\n[3489.76] Does anyone actually believe that other leaders, the international community respected us more with Biden at the helm?\n[3497.04] Does anyone actually genuine comment?\n[3499.04] Right there, they're laughing and like, ah, this guy, you're in core you're incorrigible or whatever generic you're incorrigible.\n[3505.20] That's Finland.\n[3506.40] Wasn't Maloney the one that had to redirect him back to the meeting when they were doing the the D-Day memorial?\n[3512.72] I think so.\n[3513.52] She was the one that walked over and like grabbed him and was like, hey, by the way, be respectful.\n[3517.76] It's over here.\n[3518.64] Yeah.\n[3518.96] Yeah, exactly.\n[3519.60] This is where your country liberated our continent.\n[3522.32] Chocolate chip.\n[3524.08] By the way, so there were some all-time, all-time great photo ops, including President Trump showing off his hat collection.\n[3531.92] It's like, look, there's so many hats.\n[3534.88] That is hilarious.\n[3536.08] That was it's an episode of Gribs.\n[3538.64] That one right there goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3547.04] Still got uh it's a little blood there.\n[3540.48] Goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3546.96] Still got uh there's a little blood there.\n[3550.00] That's why it's red.\n[3551.04] I love that hat.\n[3552.48] I wish it's red on red, but it reminds me of the fact that I lived that God loves me more than you.\n[3567.76] Actually, all sport.\n[3569.12] I have to buy this on eBay.\n[3570.48] It's vintage.\n[3571.20] They stopped making it.\n[3572.32] Show the new Oval Office.\n[3573.52] This is where the magic happened.\n[3576.08] If you like it, it's all gold.\n[3577.92] I think it's a circle.\n[3579.04] Here's another uh picture.\n[3580.40] There's uh um what's in that the next one?\n[3583.28] Oh, yeah, this this picture of all the leaders gathered around the resolute desk.\n[3586.24] Look at that.\n[3587.12] They're all around there.\n[3587.84] I love how you like crammed him in.\n[3589.04] Like, you can all get closer.\n[3590.32] I need all this space.\n[3592.24] And uh the best.\n[3593.84] Here's a cap uh caption uh on X, because we put this out there.\n[3597.92] Um who posed can you bring it up?\n[3599.44] Who posted this?\n[3600.24] Huge huge wrote uh when you and your boys get caught being the weak men who create hard times.\n[3607.52] A runner up to it, uh Cole Hetty Lamar uh wrote Maloney.\n[3611.52] I was told there would be antipasto.\n[3616.72] I still don't fully know what that's it's like uh it's like appetizers in Italy.\n[3620.64] Yes, yes, okay.\n[3621.44] Well now I think she's the Italian, yeah.\n[3623.20] I just thought it was like something that didn't like the pasta.\n[3626.24] Okay, hey, and it's like cheese and wine and stuff like that.\n[3630.08] It's not enough to be anti this thing.\n[3631.92] You gotta get your own thing.\n[3633.20] Now, this picture may have been the best one right here.\n[3636.48] Look at that.\n[3636.96] It's the worst Avengers movie ever.\n[3641.28] But to be clear, they were also getting ready for the evening's festivities.\n[3645.12] I want it.\n[3649.44] We figure we throw it in.\n[3651.12] That's cohesion, huh?\n[3652.08] Yeah, no.\n[3653.60] So, and we're going to get to you're wrong about everything here, and the references are all available link in the description.\n[3659.60] This means that legacy media, seeing the man who's not supposed to be respected by the international community being unilaterally respected by the international community, seeing the man who was supposed to be a feckless, ineffective celebrity president being incredibly effective and accomplishing what no other leader's been able to do for years.\n[3675.68] Um, well, that made them spurg, and that means that they're completely up in arms, uh, accusing Donald Trump of abandoning Europe, doing Putin's bidding, you know, the same tired talking points that don't really apply, but they still try and apply him.\n[3688.64] The president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, decided to have a meeting with him, and then decided to invite him to the United States of America.\n[3697.60] He didn't have to do that.\n[3698.80] And then you're showing it, rolled out literally a red carpet for him.\n[3703.20] Putin clearly won.\n[3704.48] There's no world in which Donald Trump he doesn't like multilateral meetings because he likes to be able to bully people on their own.\n[3709.92] It's unusual.\n[3711.28] All the stuff you just saw doesn't even happen for our democratic allies.\n[3714.88] Got a flyover, a red carpet, fly.\n[3716.96] A lot of handshakes.\n[3718.32] A lot of great state TV coverage back called.\n[3720.80] How many times have you seen any of our democratic allies or NATO allies or allies in Asia treated like that?\n[3727.20] It doesn't even have to be.\n[3768.32] From former U.S.\n[3769.28] Secretary of State and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, here's what she has to say.\n[3775.28] This post she just put out a short time ago.\n[3777.68] She says, if Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.\n[3788.32] Does this let me ask you this?\n[3789.44] Does this actually work on anybody?\n[3791.04] Does that kind of assholery work on anybody?\n[3794.24] If if without Ukraine ceding any territory, tell me when that's ever happened in the history of mankind.\n[3799.92] An inferior nation militarily, and if not for Western Mike coming to help them, coming to terms in a war that they're losing without compromising anything.\n[3810.72] Oh, okay.\n[3811.60] You're trying to set up a standard that could never possibly be met.\n[3814.48] And as the as for the man saying they're gonna gaslight.\n[3818.24] Do you mean like gaslighting in the way that you said these leaders wouldn't meet with Donald Trump in the way that you said these leaders have no respect for President Trump?\n[3828.08] Because we're going to get to the exact words from these leaders while they were all meeting on one side of the table with Donald Trump.\n[3835.36] And let's keep that in mind, the word gaslighting.\n[3837.60] It's time for why everything you say.\n[3841.12] You're wrong about everything.\n[3846.48] Wrong.\n[3847.76] All right, let's start with the left.\n[3849.52] So what they say is that Friday's meeting with Putin was stupid, pointless, and uh something.\n[3854.96] Well, I think last Friday, that Alaska summit was one of the most disastrous summits that I can think of.\n[3860.64] Oh no.\n[3861.44] Uh did no good in terms of advancing America's interests or the interests of our allies or Ukraine.\n[3867.60] And we treated this horrible dictator who terrorizes Ukrainians every single night, as you just showed by killing them through these attacks on civilians.\n[3877.92] Uh, we treated him like he was some special uh friend of the United States.\n[3882.08] Okay, here's the reality.\n[3883.76] Okay.\n[3884.96] The NATO Secretary General Mark Root thanked President Trump.\n[3888.48] He didn't say it's completely pointless, rolled out a red carpet.\n[3891.52] He thanked President Trump for being the only person in years to finally break the deadlock.\n[3899.68] His words.\n[3907.36] Basically, uh with President Putin by starting the dialogue.\n[3910.96] And I think it was in February that you had to first phone call, and from there, we are now where we are today.\n[3917.28] Uh and that is uh, I think if we play this well, we could end it.\n[3921.52] And we have to end it.\n[3922.56] We have to stop the killing, we have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure.\n[3926.88] It is a terrible war.\n[3928.48] Um, so I'm I'm really excited.\n[3930.80] By the way, that man's not a conservative as you would know it to be in the United States.\n[3935.20] So you have the left in the United States.\n[3937.12] This is not it's accomplished nothing.\n[3938.48] He's sucking up to him, and you have that man, the man who would know, thanking President Trump for breaking the deadlock.\n[3947.12] Does that sound like we're less respected in the international?\n[3950.24] You know who didn't break the deadlock?\n[3952.16] Biden.\n[3952.96] Here's another one.\n[3953.84] The left.\n[3954.56] They claim that President Trump is still sucking up to Putin.\n[3959.20] What the Europeans are coming to give Trump some support, some ballast.\n[3963.92] By the way, join Rumble Premium because we have to go.\n[3965.68] We're running late.\n[3966.16] If not, you're gonna see Tim Poole.\n[3967.52] Cut it.\n[3968.08] I mean, I'm not sure.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

you are unfamiliar with Adal, kind of like manual windows.\n[187.36] We realized that after yesterday's sketch, but I think you get it in principle.\n[191.12] Welcome uh viewers coming in from Vince.\n[193.12] Uh of course, Bon Gino Army.\n[194.80] We're glad to have you here.\n[195.52] I know that Bonino has some assistance over there at the uh the old FBI, which reminds me.\n[200.40] Is James Comey okay?\n[202.40] I mean, I know he's a cross dresser, tell everybody, but I don't know if he's okay when you see his latest video.\n[207.68] We're gonna talk about that today.\n[208.64] He's a swifty.\n[212.48] He's a swifty, and s and old Swift inspired him to stand up against Trump.\n[217.04] And by stand up against Trump, I mean lie about Donald Trump and try and destroy his career, his credibility, and his livelihood.\n[222.48] So we're gonna talk about that.\n[223.44] It's no small thing.\n[224.56] Chris Pratt was on with Bill Maher.\n[226.72] Um I like Chris Pratt.\n[229.76] There was a uh a black leftist.\n[233.36] Picture her in your head.\n[234.48] Yep.\n[236.08] On Jubilee, I think it's what is it called?\n[238.16] Uh surrounded with 20 black conservatives.\n[240.40] That's fun, and it shows you everything wrong with black liberalism today.\n[243.04] And hey, is there headway to be made?\n[244.40] That's my question to you.\n[245.68] Remember the black sit sort of uh or sorry, Blex it never really materialized.\n[249.68] And we saw a huge shift in Latino votes, Hispanic votes, where younger Hispanic men are now actually voting uh as a majority Republican block.\n[257.84] Do you see that oscillation that's never really shifted with the black American vote ever going Republican?\n[263.12] And I don't mean in social media world, I mean in the real world.\n[265.28] Then of course, most important President Trump uh had his meeting with Zelensky, and um the left wants us to fail, and by that, I mean they want more war.\n[276.00] Either you want President Trump to succeed, and he is right now.\n[278.80] We're making a lot of headway here, which is good for Americans, or you want him to fail, in which case you want perpetual war.\n[285.36] By the way, the next commercial you're about to see, it's a new sponsor.\n[288.24] There's a lot of legal stuff that had to be included at the end.\n[291.04] So we'll see.\n[293.20] Yeah, I thought that was a kid's pool toys, the squeakers.\n[299.44] Sound I'll never forget.\n[306.72] Oh, hey, scene is Would you just would you just drive up it?\n[311.60] I'm a Claren.\n[313.52] That's like a 200,000 dollar car.\n[316.16] But that one out there.\n[317.20] Well.\n[320.56] It's a $50,000 Rolex, Billy.\n[322.88] Yeah, I guess it is, yeah.\n[324.40] New suit.\n[325.52] Yeah, it's great, isn't it?\n[327.84] Weren't you and I just having a conversation last week about your credit score being shot?\n[333.36] Was that last week?\n[334.56] Last week.\n[335.52] Oh.\n[338.24] No, it's not anybody's guess.\n[340.16] This is what it is, Billy.\n[342.24] 200,000 car, a $50,000 watch, and I remani's suit.\n[347.44] It's a mystery.\n[348.40] No, there's no mystery.\n[349.44] Your credit score is shot because of these completely unnecessary lavish purchases.\n[354.64] Oh.\n[355.52] Download the the kickoff app.\n[357.20] We talked about it.\n[357.92] They they help build your credit fast.\n[360.72] If you do that, I don't know if they'll help you with this, but give it a sharp house.\n[366.72] Killer suit, though, right?\n[369.52] Stop.\n[371.44] Billy, what's going on

dollars.\n[393.12] Yeah, I guess.\n[394.72] Check it out.\n[400.24] Users for credit under 600 ruin average of 84 points in their first year with on-time payments.\n[403.44] With transparent affordable plan starting at just five dollars a month, no hidden fee, zero interest.\n[406.08] Kickoff helps you score big when it comes to credit.\n[407.44] It's simple.\n[407.76] You make on time payments, credit bureau, see good behavior, and your credit can grow fast.\n[409.92] Start building credit with kickoff for as well as one dollar.\n[411.92] That's eight percent normal price.\n[412.80] When you go to get kick off.com slash crowder today.\n[414.40] That's kick off with the get kick off.com slash crowd.\n[464.24] Yeah, I bet you'll get a call, Gerald.\n[467.60] Here's the thing I will say.\n[469.04] I will say this kickoff, and it's one of the few products I wearing a couple of things.\n[472.00] It's one of the few products that I don't use because I have stellar credit.\n[475.20] But uh it's really useful and it works, but there's so much stuff that needs to be included.\n[479.28] We were like, do we re uh okay, all right, but I do recommend it.\n[482.24] If you have if you have credit, that's bad.\n[484.00] Hey, it'll help you.\n[484.96] I just I don't know how long this I don't know how long the sponsorship's gonna last.\n[488.72] I need a shirt, guys.\n[489.60] I got so screwed up by all this, I kept my normal shirt on.\n[493.44] All right.\n[494.32] Uh and let me ask you this also another Donald Duck.\n[498.00] What?\n[498.48] Oh yeah.\n[507.28] Still one of the hardest uh times I've ever left in my life was you voicing Donald Trump Donald Duck being raped.\n[515.28] By the way, I don't say that to be profane, that's an actual thing that Doug do.\n[518.24] They do it to establish a pecking order.\n[520.72] Established!\n[523.60] Oh yeah, I got a lake in front of my house, dude.\n[525.52] It's sex city out there.\n[526.64] Dude, there are not people think it's orgy town.\n[529.76] What was Toolman?\n[530.56] You just went to color bars?\n[531.52] What was that?\n[532.00] Yeah, that was uh I thought it was kind of cool.\n[533.68] Wrong.\n[534.16] Alright.\n[534.64] Can you admonish yourself?\n[536.08] Hey, the good news is you can tune in to this level of quality every weekday, 11 a.m.\n[539.36] Eastern.\n[540.08] Captain Morgan, CEO, I know you're well.\n[541.92] Friday and Saturday, August 22nd and 23rd in Portland, Oregon, Helium Comedy Club.\n[546.96] Uh Josh Eerstein looking uh looking

Yeah.\n[558.32] Yeah.\n[558.64] Yeah.\n[559.04] I thought you were saying it was this week in like a Dawson's Creek reunion.\n[562.08] That's also happening in Portland.\n[563.36] We're gonna burn down a precinct that's gonna be great.\n[565.12] I liked Pacey.\n[566.00] I love how by the way, one of the assistants just brought in another shirt for Gerald.\n[570.08] Because he's so I thought she was gonna I thought she's gonna come in.\n[575.44] I thought she was gonna come in and be like, uh, kickoff has kicked us off.\n[578.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[580.16] All right.\n[580.88] Uh while Gerald was getting changed.\n[583.04] By the way, nice traps.\n[584.64] Yeah, good traps on that guy.\n[586.64] Hair all over him.\n[587.36] It's a stuff of children's nightmares.\n[588.96] So let me ask you this before I move on.\n[591.04] Uh hey, uh, you know all cultures are equal.\n[593.92] Mm-hmm.\n[594.72] Hell.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[599.28] Ping.\n[590.16] This before I move on.\n[591.52] Hey, uh, you know, all cultures are equal.\n[594.72] Oh.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[600.16] Cow dung.\n[601.12] Can't be a luxury skincare.\n[602.88] Think again.\n[603.76] This is cowpeti's lavender and fun seed soap, a patented formula.\n[608.40] That is a pure genius.\n[610.08] Made from dry, beautified cow dung from indigenous cow blended with living.\n[614.72] Beautiful seeds and uh gotta be in indigenous cow dung.\n[619.44] DP hybrids and even helps heal skin issues like eczema wounds and mood.\n[624.88] It forms a legend.\n[626.56] Smells amazing from the start to finish, and outlaws so it says no paravents, no sulfates, no toxins, just clean seats gear.\n[637.20] Speak from nature.\n[638.32] Copetti wellness through mother go.\n[641.20] A couple of things that really are upsetting with that.\n[643.20] Number one is that someone will actually look at that and go, oh no, parabens.\n[646.56] That's good.\n[646.96] Yeah, you should be more concerned with the cow shit.\n[649.60] That's true.\n[650.24] I like that it's it says cowpathy, but she pronounces it cowpatty.\n[653.92] Yeah, exactly.\n[654.72] Yeah, I think that's very accurate.\n[656.16] She says outlast soap, but it sounds like outlaw soap.\n[660.24] This shower ain't big enough for the two of us.\n[663.28] And uh also when we say all cultures are equal, because here's the thing.\n[667.12] People will excuse this and go, oh, you know, yeah, cow dog.\n[669.36] First off, there's no there's no evidence that uh it will do anything other than make you smell like cowdung.\n[673.28] Second, you can't make those claims.\n[675.28] You understand that in the United States?\n[676.80] Like you can't, it will cure eczema, and it was starting the age.\n[680.32] Like she just says stuff.\n[681.76] And you can't say in the United States, you have to prove.\n[684.48] And I get it, we have a problem with the FDA, and there's a lot of red tape.\n[687.92] But for people out there who say all cultures are equal.\n[690.24] Do you also think that uh cultures are equal if only some cultures are allowed to make completely unsubstantiated medical claims?\n[696.88] What if someone out there with eczema thinks they're going to fix it with cow crap?\n[701.44] Is this why the trend of bleaching your skin is getting so big in India?\n[705.20] They're putting cow dung all over themselves, and they're like, oh, we gotta bleach that off.\n[708.40] That would make sense.\n[709.52] I like when they finally use soap, it has cow shit in it.\n[712.88] Yes, exactly.\n[714.96] So you can smell the way you want to.\n[716.88] That's right.\n[717.36] That's right.\n[717.84] Look!\n[719.28] Oh boy.\n[721.68] I just don't think that all cultures are equal.\n[723.76] And by that I mean some are bad and they'll remain bad, but it's a new trend.\n[727.76] This is a new trend, selling other cultures to the United States because it's novel, and it's not, or I should say India is not the only culture getting in on the action.\n[736.88] Hey, do you think that bird can't be a healthy hecka product?\n[741.92] Think again.\n[743.60] This is caca de pajaro.\n[745.76] It's made with the finest avocados, cilantro, and bird.\n[750.80] It's a sustainably sourced two in one shampoo and conditioner that will leave your hair feeling silky and smooth.\n[760.16] You look like a million pesos.\n[765.04] That's good luck.\n[766.40] Although he's basically saying you'll look like four dollar.\n[770.24] It's like it's like a thousand bucks.\n[772.64] It sounds impressive.\n[773.68] I don't think so.\n[774.48] Yeah, it is.\n[777.28] I'm gonna guess.\n[777.92] I'm gonna guess 1100.\n[779.04] Hey, great.\n[779.84] What is it?\n[780.40] All right.\n[783.84] 10 grand.\n[784.40] Because I'm American, and this place is better.\n[786.40] Yes, what's the number?\n[787.92] 53,189.\n[790.00] Whoa!\n[791.04] Coming up.\n[791.68] That's the new pay soon.\n[792.88] Hey, bro, you look like 53,489 dollars.\n[797.28] 93 cents.\n[798.16] Don't forget that, bro.\n[799.12] And bro, I round it up.\n[801.28] So get kick off.\n[804.32] Yeah.\n[807.68] Uh I'll tell you who needs to get kicked off the globe.\n[810.80] James Comey.\n[811.68] Well, that's impossible.\n[813.44] And I I this is it's it's funny, it's cringe inducing, and I warn you, this is like over a minute, and it's been cut down from six minutes.\n[822.24] But I remember I've told you this in the past where the left, they just they overuse the term gaslighting.\n[827.04] And the reason they use that is because that's what they do.\n[829.04] So James Comey, first off, he's a Swifty.\n[832.16] Okay.\n[832.48] And he talks about how being a Swifty uh allowed him to stand up to bullies like Donald Trump and gave him the strength.\n[838.64] Here's the thing.\n[839.44] We now know beyond any shadow of a doubt that there was spying on the Trump campaign, right?\n[844.16] That the Russia collusion hoax is just that a hoax.\n[846.96] It was fabricated and it was leaked to the media.\n[848.96] We we we know all of these things.\n[851.44] And he complains and talks about how Donald Trump was the only man who would come after me, and Donald Trump was the only man who I felt the need to record convert because I didn't trust.\n[859.76] What in reality he was part of a fabricated campaign to destroy a man's reputation, his ability to make a living, his family, his legacy.\n[871.12] And I would imagine that President Trump was probably aggressive and aggravated.\n[875.12] Hey, if you were in your workplace and there was an employee who was falsifying emails, pictures to try and get you fired, and to try sending them to your wife.\n[886.40] You were cheating on her, and you knew that it wasn't true, but people were believing it.\n[890.08] Everyone was.\n[890.80] Do you think he'd maybe be mad?\n[892.48] And do you think he'd maybe be a little aggressive with that guy?\n[895.20] And then would that man, James Comey, and this example in this example, would he be entitled to feign outrage and claim victim status?\n[904.24] That's what James Comey has done.\n[906.48] And that's why I believe that James Comey should face serious charges and jail time for his crimes.\n[912.32] But that's not what we're discussing today.\n[913.76] More important is that he's a Swifty, and he's been a fan of her since he was a fully grown man and she was 14.\n[919.60] Donald Trump is still president and still humiliating America on a national stage standing next to Vladimir Putin.\n[926.00] It's like a dream, a bad dream you can't wake up from.\n[929.76] But I don't want to talk about that bad dream this week.\n[931.92] I want to talk about a truly inspirational public figure named Taylor Swift.\n[935.52] This is a hostage.\n[936.56] Taylor Swift, and I go way back.\n[938.88] I went to my first concert of hers 15 years ago.\n[941.76] It was creepy then.\n[942.64] I've been to a second, and I have helped financially support the attendance of a lot of family members at others.\n[949.12] I'm in a family's Swifty group chat.\n[951.76] That's so sad.\n[952.64] I know all her music, and I listened to it in my headphones when I cut the grass.\n[958.88] Although honestly, for me, it's a tie between all too well, 10-minute version and exile, featuring Bonnie Vare.\n[965.92] At every stage of her career, she's shown a certain way of being that resonated with my kids.\n[971.44] Patya Lynn to me as a parent.\n[974.24] And she's still doing that as a grown-up.\n[977.92] Like a lot of you, I struggle with how to stand up to bullies without letting their meanness infect me and change me.\n[990.08] There are far more decent, honest, kind people in America than there are mean jerks.\n[996.56] And don't get me wrong.\n[997.76] We have our jerks, millions of them.\n[999.68] You can have noticed.\n[1000.80] Of course, we need to stand up to jerks and defend what matters.\n[1004.80] But I think we have to try to do that when you're like them.\n[1009.28] Which is what makes me think about Taylor Swift.\n[1012.56] She's made clear that she sees Donald Trump for what he is.\n[1015.92] And last year she urged Americans not to make the serious mistake of electing him.\n[1021.60] Of course, we're now living with the consequences of that mistake, but we know you were involved in a home.\n[1033.44] What's she doing?\n[1035.20] Living her best life.\n[1037.04] Producing great music and as she urged all of us to do during the podcast.\n[1042.00] Why?\n[1042.64] Not giving the jerks power over her mind.\n[1045.36] At my second Taylor Swift concert in Hartford tonight.\n[1050.96] She sang a song about it.\n[1052.80] Why does this exist?\n[1056.40] Why you gotta be so mean?\n[1057.76] And she spoke directly to the nasty people.\n[1060.08] Thank you, Taylor Swift.\n[1062.00] Keep the faith.\n[1063.28] I'm sure she'll take your advice to heart.\n[1066.40] First off, the lack of this reminds me of the you know of office space, Michael Bolton.\n[1071.28] Yeah.\n[1072.24] I celebrate his entire catalog.\n[1074.16] Like it's a joke, and he doesn't realize that it's a joke.\n[1076.16] Also, what you just saw is the problem of feminism personified.\n[1080.56] What do I mean?\n[1081.44] I mean valuing the wrong things.\n[1083.28] I mean valuing nice.\n[1084.48] Hey, Hitler was nice to kids.\n[1085.76] Osama bin Laden was nice to kids.\n[1087.60] You have plenty of horrible people who are nice.\n[1089.36] It's their actions that define them.\n[1091.84] Comey believes he's nice.\n[1093.28] Comey is underhanded, dishonest, and a man of no integrity.\n[1097.20] Who would you rather deal with?\n[1098.16] Someone who's rough around the edges, someone who sends out mean tweets, someone who tells you things that you don't like to hear, but you can count on to be the same person, or somebody who can't be relied upon to pick up your children from school, even if he gives you his word, but he does it with a smile.\n[1114.88] Feminism says nice matters.\n[1117.20] Patriarchy masculinity says that integrity, reliability, dependability, and discipline matters.\n[1125.12] If I have to pick, and Donald Trump is a very flawed man.\n[1127.52] If I have to pick a Donald Trump, or by the way, anyone like uh George Washington or a Jefferson or a Teddy Roosevelt over a Comey or Barack Obama type, I'm going with the strong man who may be a little tougher to deal with every single time.\n[1144.16] Yeah, you know who wasn't nice?\n[1145.36] Winston Churchill.\n[1146.48] That's why he was voted out only a couple years after he helped fight off the axis of evil.\n[1150.00] You know why?\n[1150.40] Because he wasn't nice enough to want socialized health care.\n[1153.92] So it's not a small thing.\n[1155.12] That is feminism personified.\n[1156.96] That is a weak, weak man, and weak men lie, and weak men are untrustworthy.\n[1163.12] And you know who loves weak men?\n[1165.20] Taylor Swift.\n[1166.48] It's clear as day.\n[1167.44] This isn't anything new, by the way.\n[1169.52] So I I don't want to be too harsh on him.\n[1171.44] Plenty of intelligence officials have taken uh cues and great influence from the pop stars of their time.\n[1177.12] Uh who can forget J.\n[1178.00] Edgar Hoover professing his undying love for share.\n[1181.04] Do you believe and of course there was the poorly received Joseph.\n[1180.24] Share.\n[1187.60] And of course, there was the poorly received Joseph McCarthy Ziggy Stardust era.\n[1192.56] This is God.\n[1197.92] And some were a swing and a miss.\n[1200.00] Who can forget the big flop with uh, of course, the head over there, Christopher.\n[1204.88] Uh baby, I was born this Ray.\n[1209.44] Rama Rama.\n[1211.36] The point is gay.\n[1214.32] All right.\n[1216.24] Uh.\n[1217.28] Hey, you know what?\n[1218.48] Uh, you could be a pastor somewhere with that effeminate kind of male thing going on.\n[1224.16] That's I I hate seeing that.\n[1226.16] Listen, it doesn't mean you have to, you know, be some guy that goes out and crushes beers on your skull or something like that.\n[1231.36] No, of course not.\n[1232.40] That's what I'm saying.\n[1233.84] Complaining about bullying when you're the head of the FBI at one point.\n[1237.12] Yeah.\n[1237.52] For four years, you were the head of the FBI and you're complaining about bullying?\n[1240.96] Here's the thing, too.\n[1241.60] That's that's a weird thing.\n[1243.04] It's really easy for them to act nice.\n[1244.48] Right, think about it.\n[1245.12] Everyone thought that Barack Obama was per hey, he's the kind of guy you want to have a beer with.\n[1248.40] By the way, best way to follow me is download the Rumble app, follow me there.\n[1251.28] You'll get this show where live weekdays at 11 a.m.\n[1253.36] Eastern.\n[1253.76] Don't be tied to an algorithm on social media.\n[1256.72] Think about this.\n[1257.36] He accuses Donald Trump of bullying.\n[1259.12] Donald Trump was a, no, wealthy?\n[1261.44] Sure.\n[1261.92] But we all know that wealth doesn't necessarily get you into office, right?\n[1265.04] As seen by spending more money than ever, the uh Kamala Harris campaign.\n[1270.00] Grey Ray, Christopher Ray, Barack Obama, and of course you can sort of add in Hillary Clinton.\n[1275.44] They all took part in a concerted campaign to spy on, destroy the reputation of and leak false information against one man who they didn't like.\n[1286.64] Can you think of any more clear example of bullying than that?\n[1290.24] Right.\n[1290.72] But because Donald Trump said, go screw yourself or whatever.\n[1294.16] We're supposed to believe he's the bully.\n[1295.76] The most powerful people on earth tried to secure their positions of power by as a gang bullying an individual they didn't like who, by the way, was supported by the American public.\n[1308.16] And just to be clear, and I know Ray, the timeline, he's he's gone after that.\n[1312.56] But after Donald Trump did win, they still trumped up a fabricated campaign to delegitimize him, knowing that it was false.\n[1323.28] They were bullying you.\n[1325.04] These people in position when people say it's a big club and you're not in it, they're talking about the Rays, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bidens.\n[1332.00] You understand that they're not talking about the Trumps.\n[1334.00] They're not talking about a real estate agent from New York.\n[1336.48] I can't think of a worse bully and a bully more corrosive to the American fabric.\n[1341.36] You want to know why you don't trust your institutions?\n[1343.36] The left wants to blame you when they want to create a department of misinformation.\n[1346.24] It's Christopher Ray.\n[1348.56] It's Comey.\n[1350.48] That's why you don't trust your institutions.\n[1352.56] And you shouldn't.\n[1354.32] Someone who probably understands where you're coming from.\n[1356.32] Chris Pratt was on Bill Mars uh show.\n[1359.52] Um not the HBO one that people watch, but the one that is entirely uh guest dependent.\n[1365.44] And it's true.\n[1367.92] I will say this.\n[1368.56] You can criticize Chris Pratt there because we all know that he's a uh a a Christian, and I would tend to guess that he leans more conservative, moderate, though he hasn't been super clear about that, but he's very clear about his faith.\n[1379.68] You could uh criticize him for being a fence sitter if you watch the clips, I think in full context, maybe maybe not.\n[1387.04] You could criticize him for being a little milk toast, maybe, but that's not why the left criticizes criticizes him on uh on his appearance on Bill Maher.\n[1396.32] They watched what you're about to watch, and people on the left believe that Chris Pratt is literally Hitler.\n[1402.16] Let's see.\n[1403.04] And in politics, you you inherit enemies.\n[1405.04] And when you jump on in in on, you know, the bandwagon with who is you know the most divisive president ever.\n[1413.12] It makes sense that you're going to be uh made to look terrible.\n[1420.08] And so I don't know what to believe.\n[1421.68] Because I it's not like I sit with Bobby and I go, so hey, let's talk about this.\n[1424.96] Let's talk about it.\n[1425.52] It's like we're just playing cards or playing mafia or having fun or having dinner.\n[1428.48] I'm not gonna pick his brain to find out exactly which of those things are true.\n[1431.04] I just kind of assume that none of them are.\n[1433.12] And for the most part, I wish him well, man.\n[1435.44] I hope that's kind of things that he uh oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way, like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food.\n[1445.04] I think that's a great thing.\n[1446.48] And so just if you just do that, that's amazing.\n[1449.60] I I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be have an allergic reaction to.\n[1457.36] To be like, oh, well, if they do it, I don't want it to happen.\n[1460.32] Um I'll feed my I'll put Clorox in my children's cereal myself.\n[1465.68] Come on, have some be reasonable here.\n[1467.52] There's certain things that would be a good thing to have.\n[1469.04] Uh I want them all to be successful.\n[1471.52] So you may say, like, ah, you know, hey, you could take that a little bit further, Mr.\n[1475.44] Pratt.\n[1476.00] No, I'm not saying that because that's not his job.\n[1478.08] He's an actor.\n[1478.88] Yeah.\n[1480.00] But the left is saying that was that was far enough.\n[1483.36] Did you hear what he said?\n[1484.40] That brings us to Reddit Retards.\n[1491.92] Bang him.\n[1493.28] And just in case you say I'm taking it out of contact.\n[1495.12] Go watch the entire interview.\n[1496.24] It's very similar to that in in tone.\n[1498.32] I would like it if Bill Marr let his guests speak a little more, but that's neither here nor there.\n[1501.60] Well, he was high, so we didn't know.\n[1503.28] So on Reddit, the responses to what you just saw.\n[1505.84] Best animator 182.\n[1508.08] The hatred is extremely reasonable, and Chris Rat.\n[1512.00] I like how they changed the name there.\n[1513.68] Is an idiot.\n[1514.72] There is nothing admirable about policies rooted in eugenics.\n[1520.24] Mentally retarded.\n[1522.00] Well, also no animations there.\n[1524.00] Uh kind of a fake name.\n[1525.84] Yeah.\n[1526.64] Yeah.\n[1526.96] Also, um, I think you might want to do a little bit, uh, a little bit of a uh a background check on eugenics.\n[1533.04] And particularly the history in the uh the 19th and 20th century.\n[1537.28] Not gonna like how it turns up, buttercup Kendall underscore with underscore one underscore L.\n[1543.68] Chris Pratt wants to kill all autistic people.\n[1547.44] Maybe she's retarded.\n[1548.80] No, actually, that was Margaret Sanger.\n[1550.32] Look into Planned Parenthood.\n[1551.52] Wow.\n[1551.84] She gotta change her name to two L's.\n[1553.28] Yeah, he wants to take out red dye from food.\n[1556.08] Or actually, I let me let me really represent Chris Pratt's position uh as accurately as I can.\n[1561.44] He doesn't want to be so mired in hatred that he blindly has to be angry about RFK Jr.\n[1567.52] doing something like removing a notable, a known toxin from children's cereal.\n[1574.16] Contrast that with Margaret Sanger, um, Planned Parenthood specifically wanted to eliminate any and all babies with birth defects.\n[1581.84] And by the way, also most black babies.\n[1584.00] Feisty underscore B 9175.\n[1587.44] What an idiot.\n[1588.72] Not surprising though.\n[1590.16] He is hyper religious and spouts Christian.\n[1593.28] That's corrected from the person who calls him an idiot.\n[1596.48] Bible verses publicly all the time.\n[1598.96] I put him up there, were I think with the other nut job has been actors like Dean Kane, Kevin Sorbo, and Jenny McCarthy.\n[1608.88] McCarthy.\n[1612.96] I've spent enough I've spent quite a bit of time with Dean Kane and Kevin Sorbo has been on the show.\n[1616.56] Uh I I know for certain that uh Dean Kane knows how to spell with.\n[1621.68] I mean, we can try.\n[1622.96] They were literally shaking typing on the comics at is it AI or Al.\n[1628.16] Some of us are old enough to remember the MAGA GOP hissy fits when Michelle Obama promoted healthier eating habits as first lady.\n[1635.28] Wonder what this Pratt had to say about that.\n[1638.32] I hate being retarded.\n[1639.84] Here's the thing.\n[1640.88] No one has a problem with somebody telling you to be healthier.\n[1644.80] The Michelle Obama campaign, right?\n[1647.76] The healthier school lunches were a complete failure again because it was predicated on the uh the idea that government could fix everything.\n[1653.12] The lunches were expensive, they were gross.\n[1655.20] Kids refused to eat them, so they just ended up trading them for other goodies and treats.\n[1659.36] It increased it waste.\n[1660.88] Kids were still hungry because they wouldn't eat the lunches.\n[1663.20] And by the way, it's at the same time as Barack Obama eliminated the presidential fitness test.\n[1667.28] So if you're going to say, hey, everyone, let's move more, let's be healthier.\n[1671.84] Great.\n[1672.40] Don't combine that with all body types are just as beautiful and healthy.\n[1676.08] And don't eliminate the presidential fitness test.\n[1678.08] It was about making people feel good no matter what they did, as opposed to being based on results.\n[1682.80] Also, the issue there is that she wasn't president and we're tired of the first lady's stupid pet projects.\n[1690.40] She's gonna stay busy.\n[1691.76] Yeah.\n[1692.88] The healthy school lunch program, just to be clear, it was about as successful and gross as Mexico's school lunch program.\n[1703.60] Muy delicioso.\n[1707.52] This has been Reddit Retards.\n[1716.64] Gerald, plug the merch store before we get to the blacks.\n[1719.20] Go to Crattershop.com right now to get this shirt, not the one that I was wearing a minute ago.\n[1723.36] There's only two genders or pro gun or pro cow poop.\n[1727.28] I don't think we have a pro cow poop.\n[1728.56] No, I'm very anti.\n[1729.68] Probably find one as a general rule.\n[1731.60] I don't know.\n[1731.92] We'll see.\n[1732.32] Pro dung.\n[1732.96] Yeah.\n[1733.36] Crowder shop.com.\n[1734.32] Find something cool.\n[1734.96] Good word, by the way.\n[1736.40] We had one employee here who literally smelled like cow poop.\n[1739.12] Really?\n[1739.60] Yeah, it was short-lived.\n[1740.56] Oh, we don't know.\n[1741.36] You know, you remember.\n[1743.36] So I don't want to get into too much detail.\n[1748.00] Uh it was I will tell you this.\n[1750.48] Look, look, for as much as people like love to bitch about the boss, we had to have meetings on how to approach uh a person who smelled so bad that other employees were complaining without hurting their feelings or sort of stepping on a legal liability landmine.\n[1766.00] Do you have any idea how difficult that is?\n[1767.92] When you have a you have employees threatening to quit because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.04] Yes.\n[1770.24] Because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.12] Yes.\n[1779.52] How about uh you start a prank war.\n[1781.04] Uh-huh.\n[1781.52] Tell them what's a prank war, and then they're the only one that gets pranked.\n[1784.32] And it's like they walk through a door and you know, soap falls on it.\n[1788.08] Yes.\n[1788.32] So they hit a tripwire as they walk by their desk, and then Fabrizio just goes.\n[1794.24] Yes, exactly.\n[1795.20] They behind a door and it's just a tool chest.\n[1797.20] Like, what was that?\n[1798.00] It was the sound of 5,000 bars of ivory coming down to stairs.\n[1802.96] I prayed to you.\n[1803.92] I covered your seat in dryer sheets.\n[1806.16] Yeah.\n[1807.36] It was uncomfortable.\n[1808.72] Speaking of uncomfortable.\n[1810.64] Guys, I did take a shower.\n[1812.88] So uh let me ask you this.\n[1814.64] Can you identify, and I'm not talking about talking heads.\n[1817.12] I'm not talking about people who are uh just in the space where they they revolve around political commentary.\n[1821.76] Can you identify a major black celebrity who's conservative?\n[1826.88] I heard Denzel Washington.\n[1828.72] Uh no, he's he's he's voted Democrat, he's a Christian, and he encourages accountability, but doesn't fully connect the dots.\n[1834.48] And by the way, I from everything that I've seen and heard like Denzel Washington, we probably would disagree on some issues politically.\n[1841.04] Uh another question for you do you think there's ever going to be a point where the scales tip?\n[1846.88] Because we saw it with Hispanic votes.\n[1848.48] We saw it with Gen Z.\n[1849.68] We've never seen it to a significant degree with black votes in America.\n[1852.64] And we have more black representatives or commentators uh than ever.\n[1857.52] You know, back when we were growing up, you pretty much had Thomas Sowell and kind of Larry Elder.\n[1861.84] Um Alan Keyes, Herman King Alfonso Rachel was an early and OG.\n[1865.76] I'd recommend go checking him out on YouTube.\n[1867.44] He was one of the first people there.\n[1868.72] But now you have a ton of people.\n[1870.16] The Blexit never really materialized.\n[1872.80] Do you think that it'll ever happen?\n[1875.36] Comment.\n[1877.68] And uh I I also understand why it's so um it's so tipped uh towards one side uh as far as politically with black people, because if you look or listen to anything in media, um, you will only see black celebrities assuming that you must be.\n[1900.16] You must be, unless you're a traitor, uh, liberal if you're black.\n[1905.92] We are voting for the right to choose what happens to our own bodies.\n[1912.64] We are damn black bitch.\n[1914.96] I choose you ourselves from this precipice of danger.\n[1920.40] Well, I misspelled respect.\n[1922.64] And a lot of these cake corrected me in a hashtag.\n[1929.36] Now I want y'all to help me correct President Trump to teach him what it means.\n[1934.48] Ladies and gentlemen, please.\n[1937.04] Nice haircut.\n[1937.92] Big loud Texas, welcome to the next president of the United States.\n[1945.28] Come on.\n[1946.80] You think that this guy has done stuff for black people.\n[1951.84] All I gotta say is crack is whack.\n[1955.84] I'm not trying to be funny.\n[1957.52] Well, mission accomplished.\n[1958.88] Nothing has never done enough for black folks.\n[1961.60] Thank you for all that.\n[1962.32] It's a double negative.\n[1963.12] That means he's done something.\n[1964.08] I know you guys are excited to see her.\n[1965.60] I didn't know you guys would be excited to see me too.\n[1967.60] But uh Yeah.\n[1969.68] I gotta go disappear to what I call training camp for a few weeks, come back with a bolts butt and ten new pounds of muscle.\n[1975.20] Now this brings us to uh the uh I keep wanting to say outnumbered, the surrounded, which for those of you who are unfamiliar, it's basically change my mind with a vote timer.\n[1986.88] Um it is, it really is.\n[1989.60] And this is one black radical.\n[1992.08] This is uh an actress, Amanda Seals, uh, versus 20 black um conservatives.\n[1997.44] Now, here's the thing.\n[1998.08] I w uh we're going to get into some of the claims versus the reality.\n[2002.48] Um, but this is important to to note, it's a technique that's used a lot.\n[2007.28] And I've encountered it in Change My Mind quite a bit.\n[2009.60] And right, Change My Mind was just sit down, establish uh the premise, which they refer to as a prompt, and anyone can sit down and you know, change your mind.\n[2018.88] Okay.\n[2019.76] You've seen people do this where what they do is the in betweens.\n[2023.04] If they know their argument doesn't really hold any water, they try and taint it with things like, you know, oh, you're unreasonable, or ugh, I can't believe these people must be paid actors.\n[2033.20] Or ugh, they try if their argument doesn't hold water, they try and tip those scales on a it's performance art.\n[2040.16] So as bad as you thought this was going to be with Amanda Seals, it's much worse.\n[2045.36] I'm not sure where your education came from, but they lied to you.\n[2048.80] I hope some of y'all are acting.\n[2050.40] I really do.\n[2051.68] I knew I was gonna be surrounded by ignorance, but damn, let's go.\n[2054.96] And my points are just as valid as yours, even though you got a pocket square and a church of Christ uh pin on your chest.\n[2061.28] Whatever.\n[2061.92] It's a cross, same difference.\n[2063.12] You got an American flag and you think you know something because you a cop.\n[2065.60] And ultimately not a cop, this much of it.\n[2067.60] It's a it's a cab all day over here.\n[2069.36] So let me make that clear.\n[2071.76] But you're literally speaking this.\n[2073.28] And you're not going to do that with me either.\n[2074.56] So you're stating your point.\n[2076.08] Y'all just want to be seen.\n[2077.44] I don't need to be seen.\n[2078.40] You're coming.\n[2078.96] That's why you're dressed like a poison dart frog.\n[2082.08] Just like she fell in the four buckets of the chimney or not.\n[2084.48] I have not had, you know, first of all, you're a light skin woman.\n[2087.84] So are you?\n[2088.48] Yes, and you're doing great cell.\n[2090.96] Yes, and so colorism really does serve us.\n[2094.00] This is scary.\n[2095.04] You need to think about me as your mama.\n[2096.88] Do not talk to me in that fashion.\n[2098.48] So let's check that now.\n[2100.16] See, and this is what happens too.\n[2101.68] Sometimes I refer to tone policing, but she's telling some, you need to do this.\n[2106.72] Now, I don't mean it's it's very reasonable to require someone if you are offering them respect to be respectful.\n[2112.48] Like, hey, I didn't, and I've done this.\n[2114.00] Hey, you know, I let you finish.\n[2115.36] Yeah.\n[2115.68] Uh you gotta let me finish.\n[2117.76] Or occasionally I'll go, you know what?\n[2119.76] I'm going to finish uh my thought as though you're an adult capable of giving the same respect I've given you.\n[2125.92] But that's not what she's doing.\n[2126.80] She's like, you need to think of me like yo mama.\n[2129.76] How entitled can you be?\n[2131.84] You don't get to tell someone what to think or how they should view you.\n[2135.20] Here's how someone's going to view you, usually.\n[2137.60] It's usually going to be based on your actions.\n[2141.20] And in this case, your words, your stupid, stupid words.\n[2145.84] So seals, just to give you an idea, was at the center of quite a few uh controversies herself.\n[2151.28] For example, defending Jesse Smollett, quote, even if it was a hoax.\n[2155.68] What?\n[2156.24] Yeah, this is someone who just if black people can do no wrong.\n[2159.92] Even if it was a hoax and cost taxpayer dollars in the and the city, and even if it did stir racial division and hatred, you know, another hoax too, like Michael Brown, hands up, don't shoot.\n[2169.68] Jesse Smallett's funny.\n[2171.04] Black lives matter, the terrorism, the billions of dollars in damage.\n[2174.00] That was also a hoax.\n[2176.00] So she was also kicked out of a black Emmy party.\n[2178.40] She got into a feud with a black sorority, and she claimed that she was autistic without ever actually being diagnosed, which is funny, but hey, it's not just black white.\n[2186.64] That's feminism to the letter.\n[2188.80] Just claim victim status, and you assume you win the argument, but that doesn't fly here.\n[2193.84] It's time for claim truth.\n[2199.44] Can we go back claiming autism as a tool in an argument?\n[2204.24] That's real retarded, sir.\n[2205.60] Sure.\n[2206.00] Yeah, it's a it's a it's a thing that a lot of people do.\n[2208.64] Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n[2209.92] The only person who never will is Al Sharpton who spells respect with two K's.\n[2215.36] Respect.\n[2216.32] I misspell respect.\n[2217.60] It's crazy.\n[2218.16] That was actually very revealing.\n[2219.20] Because to me, I just thought it's the way he speaks.\n[2220.88] No, in his mind, he's going, R E S P E KK, that is what it means to me.\n[2226.32] Yeah, there's a whole song.\n[2228.32] I don't know.\n[2229.28] I don't think I would ever get to the point in an argument where I'm like, but I'm retarded.\n[2233.04] Yeah.\n[2233.76] Well, you don't need to say it.\n[2234.72] I don't think you said in an argument, I think she was just claiming it.\n[2236.80] She's claiming it.\n[2237.52] Yeah, but why?\n[2238.24] Anyway.\n[2238.80] Because it's a status symbol to say.\n[2240.32] It's a victim.\n[2241.28] It is.\n[2241.60] It's like I'm a marginalized group.\n[2244.64] I'm I'm not only am I black, but I'm also a woman.\n[2247.20] And not only that, but I'm on the lowest end possible of being retarded.\n[2250.96] Yeah.\n[2251.20] No, no, no.\n[2251.68] I don't know.\n[2252.08] I I get it, but then you try to put yourself out there as somebody who can articulate the points of why reparations are a thing.\n[2258.00] Like you've basically just under, oh, so I don't need to listen to you.\n[2261.12] No, no, no.\n[2261.76] I understand you're being logical.\n[2262.96] That's your problem.\n[2263.84] Is if you take away victim status.\n[2265.76] Right.\n[2266.16] If you completely remove it.\n[2267.04] Okay.\n[2267.28] In other words, if you don't go, wait, black, white, okay, well, hold on a second, um, white woman, black guy, what uh trans, okay, disabled.\n[2274.00] Right.\n[2274.32] If you take all of that away, you actually have to um rest on the the validity of your arguments.\n[2282.16] Your actual thoughts.\n[2283.20] Yeah.\n[2283.52] Your opinions.\n[2284.16] So if you take all of the identity politics away, it just comes down to actions, performance, arguments, claims.\n[2293.28] We can't have that, and we certainly don't have that in the public school system.\n[2296.32] So the first claim uh that's made systemic ra and this has been addressed in changed my mind well over half a decade ago.\n[2306.08] Actually, systemic racism, by the way, challenge is still out there of one example today in the 21st century.\n[2311.04] Systemic racism is real, says the self-diagnosed retard.\n[2314.96] Ultimately, systemic racism exists in our institutions on a government level in our institutions, whether it's prisons or schools, and it is undeniable because they are actively trying to reinstate it right now.\n[2329.44] Okay.\n[2330.08] So the truth, it's hard to deal with claims that make no sense.\n[2334.72] I don't know what you mean by trying to reinstate it.\n[2336.40] And I watched the whole thing, and it still doesn't make sense.\n[2338.48] Uh blacks are completely proportionally represented in Congress, right?\n[2341.52] In government, okay, about 14%.\n[2343.68] And uh, as far as prison, now again, her premise, but again, she's she's on the spectrum according to her, is just black people are being put there because they're black.\n[2351.52] Black people in this country, despite making up twelve to thirteen percent of the population commit over half of all the violent crimes.\n[2358.08] And then if you look at wait systemic discrimination, okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students.\n[2360.00] Okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students who are woefully underqualified in some cases, they do.\n[2373.92] They do get in.\n[2374.72] DEI exists.\n[2377.20] And here's the thing, too.\n[2378.08] When she goes on to talk about reparations, they act as though those things have never taken place.\n[2383.12] DEI is reparational.\n[2384.40] Affirmative action is reparations.\n[2385.76] Model Cities program is reparations.\n[2387.92] EBT, SNAP, the baby mama that was created by these are reparations.\n[2391.68] Section 8 housing, more money into public school.\n[2394.32] These are reparations that have been paid to the tune of trillions of dollars and have made nothing better.\n[2400.64] Now she may say those aren't the reparations we want, but those are the reparations that exist because it's what their party and what their community, the black community, have demanded.\n[2408.96] They petitioned, they got these reparations, and it didn't work.\n[2415.04] The answer, if you ask them, so when is it enough is always more.\n[2419.60] Here's the next claim that she makes.\n[2423.12] And this is a tough one.\n[2424.24] I don't even know.\n[2424.88] It's like grabbing a bar of soap.\n[2426.64] Uh soap.\n[2428.08] Which kind of soap, yeah.\n[2429.52] Done so.\n[2430.56] Harriet Tubman was uh actually aided by white supremacy something.\n[2436.40] I refuse to embrace a victim mentality because that's not what our grandparents and Harriet Tugman and those people fall for.\n[2442.96] They fought for whatever.\n[2444.00] Do not bring that Harriet Tubman's name in vain, baby.\n[2447.52] Please name in vain.\n[2451.20] Harriet Tubman was literally, literally saving her family and others from slavery.\n[2460.00] Yeah.\n[2460.80] You know who helped her white people.\n[2462.64] You know who helped her.\n[2463.68] They were on the underground railroad.\n[2465.04] No, no, no, no, you know, helped her.\n[2466.96] Come on, even though you know who helped her?\n[2469.44] Guy.\n[2470.16] And there are people who benefit from white supremacy.\n[2473.36] What?\n[2474.40] That guy had answers.\n[2475.60] Yeah, he did.\n[2476.64] He did.\n[2477.52] Uh, okay, so the truth to this one.\n[2481.52] I uh uh okay.\n[2483.76] So here's my understanding of her uh of her uh again, self-diagnosed uh autistic argument is that um white people helped Harriet Tubman, but they could only help her because they were beneficiaries of white supremacy, therefore white supremacy helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2499.60] Okay, so you don't want allies.\n[2502.48] Get it done with 12% of the population.\n[2505.44] I would help, but I benefit from white supremacy.\n[2508.40] Everyone in this room, by the way, you're precluded from helping because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2512.40] Tell that to the Quaker Church who helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2515.20] Yeah.\n[2515.76] Tell it to Massachusetts Governor uh John Andrew.\n[2518.96] Tell it to the multiple whites who helped with the underground railroad specifically, just to be clear.\n[2524.56] No, no, no, you guys all have to stop because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2528.56] Oh, so the slaves should do it on their own.\n[2531.04] This is a way of removing any and all credit for the good deeds that white people have committed.\n[2538.00] In the name of I know this is inconvenient.\n[2540.32] Modern Christianom.\n[2541.76] Yeah.\n[2542.40] I don't understand what what this point like if you didn't have white people, nobody would know about Harriet Tubman.\n[2548.08] You know why?\n[2549.04] She wouldn't have made it.\n[2550.08] We wouldn't let you write books about it, and you wouldn't be free.\n[2553.04] Mm-hmm.\n[2553.84] So maybe just saying thank you.\n[2556.24] You know who else is the benefit uh who's benefited from white supremacy?\n[2559.52] Um, the wealthiest celebrities on earth.\n[2561.92] There you go.\n[2562.48] Beyonce, NJZ, the top box office draws of the night, the uh Will Smith of the world, the Denzel Washington's of the world, the three most recognizable faces on earth in the 90s, Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson, kind of, that's a half one, Mike Tyson.\n[2576.08] Because white people you know who else?\n[2577.44] Barack Obama, president of the United States.\n[2579.28] I know that one's pretty crazy.\n[2580.72] That's rough.\n[2581.44] Also, white people, the ones who've given you the platform to speak these kinds of asinine opinions uh in a show like surrounded, not outnumbered.\n[2592.00] Surrounded.\n[2592.56] The next claim that she makes.\n[2595.28] That blacks absolutely do need reparations, and she's gonna make an airtight case.\n[2600.24] Now, let me land the plane.\n[2601.52] We're talking about reparations, and what you're doing is actually female pilot.\n[2606.32] The fact is reparations are just and necessary because on a basic level, black people built this country, and the country continues to thrive off of the labor that black people put into this country, and it would behoove you, young man, to really understand the way that your ancestors put blood, sweat, and tears into this nation that is still living off of those blood, sweat and tears.\n[2628.80] Okay, and I'll open this up to you guys, but here's the truth.\n[2630.72] All right, couple of things.\n[2631.76] I just addressed this, right?\n[2632.88] When you talk about EBT snap, section eight housing, more money to public schools, when you talk about affirmative action, DEI.\n[2638.32] These are all forms of reparations, to be clear.\n[2640.88] I think at some point she says repatriations.\n[2642.56] I'm not entirely sure she kind of delineates between the two.\n[2644.80] Remunerations.\n[2645.52] Is that what she says?\n[2646.08] Yeah, remunerations, sorry.\n[2647.36] Renumerations.\n[2648.48] Um.\n[2651.04] And she'll say, well, that's not what now we're asking for money.\n[2653.52] Okay, great, but those things exist because your community and the Democrat Party said that those were required.\n[2660.40] Okay?\n[2661.04] Those were required.\n[2662.00] That's the rep to the tune of trillions of dollars.\n[2664.88] Why is that not enough?\n[2666.16] And by the way, why do reparations need to be paid to a 15-year-old black guy?\n[2672.24] What kind of reparations does Jesse Smallett deserve?\n[2675.12] And is it wiped out by what he costs the good good taxpaying citizens of Chicago?\n[2680.96] I know you say you should defend him anyway because it's just a hoax.\n[2683.68] Oh, that's right.\n[2684.40] Now I'm getting it.\n[2685.44] The answer is always more money, please, more money, please.\n[2688.88] You asked for reparations.\n[2691.28] You may not like them now.\n[2692.56] It's what you asked for.\n[2694.64] You got them.\n[2696.64] You're saying it's not enough.\n[2698.88] Now you're on your own.\n[2700.40] The other thing is, by the way, I'm so tired of this.\n[2702.96] All references available, link in the descriptions.\n[2705.60] Um blacks built this country.\n[2708.08] No, they didn't.\n[2709.44] No, they didn't.\n[2710.64] In comparison to the labor in this country, and certainly in comparison to the businesses created and the innovations uh in this country, and yes, manual labor, especially if you look at the industrial revolution.\n[2722.48] You look at these great booms that took place in this country.\n[2725.28] It is not because of black people.\n[2728.56] They took part in it, but not any greater part than any well.\n[2732.72] 75%, by the way, of Southerners didn't own any slaves whatsoever.\n[2735.76] States like California never had any slaves, to be clear.\n[2738.96] And while we're talking about this, the vast majority of slaves, anywhere from 90% to 96%, I think the high number, 96% comes from Cornell West.\n[2747.68] Uh, they were sold into slavery by West African slave traders.\n[2752.40] Also, if you want to go buy yourself a slave today, you can still do it in plenty of African nations.\n[2757.76] You're gonna be dealing with a black person, though, so don't be surprised.\n[2761.36] Here's the next part of this is um slavery, too, actually can be argued through the metrics, it held the country back.\n[2770.00] The free North outperformed the South while they still had slaves in every way you could measure economically.\n[2778.08] The cotton industry exploded after slavery ended.\n[2781.52] Innovations like the cotton gin that came from the areas of the country that didn't have slavery.\n[2786.08] So this is something, and it's something that used to it's used to guilt white people.\n[2789.76] You wouldn't have this country if not for black people.\n[2792.08] Okay, well, black people, Africans who were sold by their African brothers.\n[2796.56] Hey, they're still there in countries in Africa.\n[2799.36] What does that look like?\n[2801.84] What's the difference?\n[2804.00] You have Africans and both.\n[2806.40] They're slaves in both.\n[2808.96] Slavery's wrong, to be clear, just like Hitler, bad.\n[2811.92] Africans in both slavery and slave owners alike in both.\n[2816.24] Pick a country, any country.\n[2818.64] The African continent, United States.\n[2820.56] What's the difference?\n[2821.52] Who built the country?\n[2824.08] One of the most infuriating things that she does is she makes these claims as though they're self-evident, right?\n[2829.20] She just says, yes, systemic racism exists.\n[2831.52] We were trying to think about, okay, well, how do you combat that without going down 50 rabbit holes?\n[2835.28] Okay, we'll go with what she said.\n[2836.40] Government prisons and schools.\n[2837.60] Okay, well, you can't prove that because we just disproved that.\n[2840.32] Reparations are absolutely just and needed.\n[2842.64] Okay, well, how do you prove that?\n[2844.08] Who gets it?\n[2845.04] Right.\n[2845.60] These people, we built this country, therefore, she goes to the next point as though that foundational statement is true.\n[2852.00] I just wish she would say something with some kind of factual backing.\n[2856.40] Quote a study, even if I don't agree with it, just something, a stat.\n[2860.00] Give me a number to go after.\n[2861.76] In fact, when the guy brought up statistics about black on black crime, she goes, stats lie all the time, honey.\n[2867.20] If you're gonna make your argument about stats, you already lost.\n[2870.08] Yeah.\n[2870.48] It's exactly what she did.\n[2871.44] It's like, oh, so I will never ever, you're just a racist person.\n[2874.64] Yeah.\n[2874.96] That's really what we're dealing with.\n[2876.08] They're a racist person who hates this country.\n[2878.24] Fantastic.\n[2878.88] Here's an offer from me.\n[2880.48] Not this show, from me personally.\n[2882.24] I will write you a check right now to pay to have you move to Africa.\n[2885.28] Let me Because apparently you don't like it here.\n[2887.20] Yeah.\n[2887.52] Let me ask you.\n[2888.08] I don't want to be, I don't want to be an oppressor.\n[2889.60] No, no, none of us do.\n[2890.48] Let me ask you this.\n[2891.04] If you went to Harriet Tubman back in time and said, hey, look, you can you can tomorrow, slavery is done.\n[2897.28] You don't have to do this railroad stuff.\n[2898.96] Okay, it's done.\n[2900.08] It's over.\n[2900.72] This railroad stuff.\n[2901.60] Everyone will be free.\n[2902.72] Everyone will be free.\n[2903.76] Oh, that's malarkey.\n[2905.04] But that's it.\n[2905.52] It's a fresh start.\n[2906.24] The only way we know how to do this, Miss Tubman, you've inspired us, is to break these chains.\n[2910.88] Slavery is done, but we just got to get a fresh start.\n[2912.80] We can't keep looking to the past.\n[2914.00] It's over.\n[2914.48] Everyone's free.\n[2915.68] Do you think of course she would take that deal.\n[2917.76] And if she saw seal, she would tell her to get a haircut and sew up the holes in her genes.\n[2921.60] Here's a bonus claim that she makes that uh just sort of shows that she's an actual racist.\n[2927.04] If you didn't know that by her defending Jesse Smollett because of his blackness, uh the claim here is that the Chinese aren't actual minorities or something like black people.\n[2936.32] I don't know.\n[2936.96] For example, we have the uh Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n[2939.68] We prevented Chinese people from getting citizenship and even entering the country, we discriminate against them, and basically put them under apartheid, even here in the United States.\n[2947.68] Yet they have the highest median household income.\n[2949.52] How is that possible?\n[2950.56] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to pay for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time?\n[2957.20] Which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2950.64] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to beg for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time, which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2960.32] Oh, young Matt.\n[2961.60] One, comparing Chinese people who are immigrants that made a choice to come to the United States and comparing the continued effort of black people to ground themselves in a nation that continues to make impediments for them to show and live and exist in their true citizenship is a false equivalency.\n[2979.28] I don't believe that happens at all.\n[2980.24] What a what no one here is in the world?\n[2982.16] Are you acting right now?\n[2983.12] Do you really believe that?\n[2984.80] There's a way to try and discredit the person.\n[2986.88] Yeah.\n[2987.60] Now, before I get to the truth, let me just tell you this.\n[2989.68] I'm also, I think that you're placating by saying black people kill black people in record numbers.\n[2994.80] Because that's a you know what I'm actually really concerned with?\n[2997.92] I'm also really concerned with the fact that black people kill white people in this country in record numbers.\n[3002.40] It's not just your community's problem.\n[3004.64] No.\n[3005.28] And we have a right to an opinion because we are several times more likely to be assaulted, to be mugged, to be robbed, or to be killed by a black person as a white American than by a white American.\n[3015.20] Yep, the numbers are even higher because of the proximity effect of black people living around other black people.\n[3020.08] But let's be honest about this.\n[3022.40] We're concerned that we're more likely to be the victim of crime, and you can't blame it on there not being enough affirmative action.\n[3030.80] Anyone want to c anyone agree with that?\n[3032.64] I'm tired of going, oh, the black on black crime, they're the biggest yeah, sure, they're the biggest threat to the black community.\n[3037.44] I'm very concerned with them being a threat, that community to my white children.\n[3042.00] Got it.\n[3042.64] That's a great point because in this the the longer version of the video, you know, other people brought that up.\n[3049.04] And it is a real concern.\n[3050.40] But she her response was uh, well, how many how many black people do you see uh in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3056.32] A lot.\n[3056.64] How many white people do you see in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3058.96] Uh some.\n[3059.76] Well, uh that well, then that's not that's why.\n[3061.60] That's you're not you're not in danger from white people because you don't see white people.\n[3064.48] Yeah, yeah.\n[3065.12] The only problem is if you look at the armed robbery, you look at the burglaries, you look at the violent crime taking place in the white neighborhoods, you know, the next town over, you still see the same stats.\n[3075.20] In other words, these gangs of largely black people, they travel.\n[3080.08] And we have a problem with it.\n[3081.52] Brown round get around, they get around.\n[3084.24] The browns, browns, browns, browns, they get around.\n[3088.24] Shh.\n[3090.48] But here's the truth.\n[3091.84] Uh the Chinese in the United States.\n[3094.32] It's not a false equivalent.\n[3095.36] See, they weren't even considered citizens until 1943.\n[3098.24] 1870.\n[3099.44] Wow.\n[3099.76] Is when the 15th Amendment gave black men the right to vote, to be clear.\n[3104.16] 1920, the 19th Amendment, some would say a mistake granted black women the right to vote.\n[3109.12] Not because they're black, all women.\n[3110.88] And uh today, yes, the median income for Chinese Americans is 82,000 versus 54,000 for black Americans.\n[3117.68] So they've been discriminated against far more recently, in a way that would negatively affect their income.\n[3121.92] They bounce back.\n[3123.36] And by the way, richer than the average German, just to be clear.\n[3126.72] Like the Chinese do really well.\n[3128.72] You keep saying it wrong.\n[3130.08] The Chinese.\n[3130.88] Thanks.\n[3131.20] Sorry, it's pronounced Chinese.\n[3132.48] Finally admonish me.\n[3133.60] Yes.\n[3133.92] Admonish him alone.\n[3134.88] I don't want to be ethnocentric.\n[3136.72] Do it a lot.\n[3138.64] Chinese go down with the ship, Jim.\n[3141.04] And by the way, these metrics show you uh they Chinese, they know dumb.\n[3143.84] They are doing very well.\n[3146.48] So I don't know why it's plural in other countries, but it is.\n[3148.72] Hey, so what let's let's just concede the argument that she makes right now.\n[3152.16] I just want to concede every single point, right?\n[3153.84] I know we don't want to do that, but let's just concede.\n[3155.68] Every single thing you say about white people in this country, white supremacists and Harriet Tubman, systemic racism everywhere.\n[3162.00] You're right, you're owed every single dollar in my bank account.\n[3165.04] Do you think that's going to happen?\n[3167.76] And is that the best advice for all of your constituents to try to get that?\n[3172.72] Or let's just say that they're an oppressive system that they can never get out of, which is kind of what you're claiming in the first place.\n[3178.08] Wouldn't it be better to do what the other cultures have done and just try to make the very best of it that you possibly can and try to fix that instead of just complaining and shaking your fist at the sky and saying every bad thing that happens to you is because of the white man keeping you down?\n[3191.60] That's what works.\n[3192.88] You don't care about your community.\n[3194.48] Yeah.\n[3194.80] You care about having a grievance.\n[3196.40] You care about having an excuse for failure.\n[3199.60] Right.\n[3200.24] Instead of saying, hey, we need more fathers in the home in this community.\n[3204.16] Hey, we need less violence in this community.\n[3206.00] Hey, we need better education in this community.\n[3208.08] And guess what?\n[3208.96] Those people aren't gonna give it to us.\n[3210.64] Fine.\n[3211.12] We're gonna do it ourselves.\n[3212.32] Yeah.\n[3212.72] I tell you who really wants preparations.\n[3215.20] Chrysler.\n[3216.24] Oh, I thought you said pre I thought you said preparations, and I was thinking it's big H.\n[3220.48] No.\n[3221.36] No.\n[3221.84] Reparations.\n[3223.44] I'm not gonna say it.\n[3224.16] And by the way, bring up a bonus uh for uh those who are members of Rumble Premium for Mug Club.\n[3228.16] By the way, if you're not click that button below, we'll go on for another hour.\n[3231.44] Uh it's 99 dollars, you get everything ad-free, you get 100% more show, including the Friday show, and uh it's the only thing that keeps the lights on, or try for 999 a month, where they talked about with her uh black culture, and they talked about hip hop and the things that were glorified, and she said, Well, who's the one feeding black people that?\n[3248.48] Who's the one so if if they're force feeding you junk food, and in other words, it's white people who are largely responsible for the mass consumption in the black community and rejection by the way of any and all other forms of media as it relates to gangster culture as it relates to decadence and hedonism that you see.\n[3267.84] Um, I would have loved to ask her, what's on your playlist?\n[3271.36] Yeah.\n[3272.48] What do you think's on Jesse Smollett's playlist?\n[3274.80] Why have you been dubbed duped by the evil white man?\n[3278.08] I'm guessing Jew, right?\n[3279.36] Why have you been duped?\n[3281.68] It is our fault.\n[3282.56] Yeah.\n[3282.88] We men of the bucket and the mop.\n[3284.64] Yes.\n[3285.28] Yes.\n[3286.16] Yeah.\n[3286.88] It's uh, which is after which she modeled her hairdo.\n[3290.16] Um was the other thing.\n[3292.00] Do we have a do we have a left versus reality stinger, or is it a claim truth?\n[3296.64] Uh left.\n[3298.00] We don't have any stinger for this one.\n[3299.36] Oh we just have left versus things.\n[3301.20] Yeah.\n[3301.44] I can claim truth again, but really.\n[3307.20] You know, he's been making the rounds.\n[3308.72] He's been making a lot of progress.\n[3310.56] And yesterday, he met with some of the uh some people say Euro trash.\n[3315.52] I would never say that.\n[3316.24] Leaders in DC.\n[3317.84] And it all started off before we get to some of the claims from the left where they really want this administration to fail.\n[3324.32] And by that I mean they really want never-ending war.\n[3327.44] Um, it all kicked off with a warm welcome to Zelensky who put on a suit, sort of.\n[3333.60] I guess he got the message.\n[3347.76] Trump is on your message for the people of Ukraine.\n[3350.00] We're all right.\n[3351.76] We love them.\n[3353.04] We love them.\n[3360.48] Thank you very much, everybody goes.\n[3362.88] Couple of things there.\n[3363.92] First off, when he goes, this is the best I have, this suit, change it.\n[3368.24] That's why we think you're a disrespectful little prick.\n[3371.04] Stop by men's warehouse, get a two for one.\n[3375.12] And I look, look, this is the thing too.\n[3376.88] It's funny, right?\n[3377.52] Where people are talking about all cultures, hey, hey.\n[3380.40] It's a custom here.\n[3382.16] It just so happens to be a custom on the greatest country on earth.\n[3386.56] Put on a fucking suit.\n[3389.12] President Trump also, it's not a big deal.\n[3391.60] It's just respect our culture.\n[3393.44] You know.\n[3394.40] President Trump also, uh, by the way, was in rare form.\n[3397.12] Uh he had personalized greetings for each, I would never say Euro Trash leader.\n[3401.84] Everyone knows President Macron of France, who's been with me from the beginning, one of the first people I met as a foreign dignitary, and uh I like them from day one.\n[3414.88] And I like him even more now.\n[3416.56] That's pretty good.\n[3417.44] That's unusual.\n[3419.12] That's a pretty unusual thing.\n[3421.20] Prime Minister Maloney of Italy, who's a uh really great leader and an inspiration over there.\n[3427.84] She's uh she's served now, even though she's a very young person, she's served there for a long period of time relative to others.\n[3435.04] They don't they don't last very long.\n[3436.72] You've lasted a long time.\n[3438.40] You're gonna be there a long time.\n[3439.92] Chancellor Mertz of Germany, who is uh just put your Biden in this role person, right?\n[3446.48] And a very strong leader and very highly respected, and he's my friend, and it's another friend.\n[3453.28] Thank you very much.\n[3457.60] I want to I want to get a 10 like that.\n[3460.48] Where'd you get it?\n[3461.36] I get mine from a machine.\n[3464.24] I stand and go, whoa.\n[3466.32] Here's the thing.\n[3467.04] You may not like it, but the guy has something to offer in basic communications.\n[3473.20] Like well, but they got people to to laugh.\n[3475.12] You're there for a very serious subject.\n[3476.64] You compliment people, you got them laughing.\n[3478.96] He understands how to work a room.\n[3481.04] Well, one of the biggest lies that we were ever told, and they still try and sell is you know, we're being mocked, we're being uh we're we're the laughing stock of the international stage.\n[3489.12] Comment below.\n[3489.76] Does anyone actually believe that other leaders, the international community respected us more with Biden at the helm?\n[3497.04] Does anyone actually genuine comment?\n[3499.04] Right there, they're laughing and like, ah, this guy, you're in core you're incorrigible or whatever generic you're incorrigible.\n[3505.20] That's Finland.\n[3506.40] Wasn't Maloney the one that had to redirect him back to the meeting when they were doing the the D-Day memorial?\n[3512.72] I think so.\n[3513.52] She was the one that walked over and like grabbed him and was like, hey, by the way, be respectful.\n[3517.76] It's over here.\n[3518.64] Yeah.\n[3518.96] Yeah, exactly.\n[3519.60] This is where your country liberated our continent.\n[3522.32] Chocolate chip.\n[3524.08] By the way, so there were some all-time, all-time great photo ops, including President Trump showing off his hat collection.\n[3531.92] It's like, look, there's so many hats.\n[3534.88] That is hilarious.\n[3536.08] That was it's an episode of Gribs.\n[3538.64] That one right there goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3547.04] Still got uh it's a little blood there.\n[3540.48] Goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3546.96] Still got uh there's a little blood there.\n[3550.00] That's why it's red.\n[3551.04] I love that hat.\n[3552.48] I wish it's red on red, but it reminds me of the fact that I lived that God loves me more than you.\n[3567.76] Actually, all sport.\n[3569.12] I have to buy this on eBay.\n[3570.48] It's vintage.\n[3571.20] They stopped making it.\n[3572.32] Show the new Oval Office.\n[3573.52] This is where the magic happened.\n[3576.08] If you like it, it's all gold.\n[3577.92] I think it's a circle.\n[3579.04] Here's another uh picture.\n[3580.40] There's uh um what's in that the next one?\n[3583.28] Oh, yeah, this this picture of all the leaders gathered around the resolute desk.\n[3586.24] Look at that.\n[3587.12] They're all around there.\n[3587.84] I love how you like crammed him in.\n[3589.04] Like, you can all get closer.\n[3590.32] I need all this space.\n[3592.24] And uh the best.\n[3593.84] Here's a cap uh caption uh on X, because we put this out there.\n[3597.92] Um who posed can you bring it up?\n[3599.44] Who posted this?\n[3600.24] Huge huge wrote uh when you and your boys get caught being the weak men who create hard times.\n[3607.52] A runner up to it, uh Cole Hetty Lamar uh wrote Maloney.\n[3611.52] I was told there would be antipasto.\n[3616.72] I still don't fully know what that's it's like uh it's like appetizers in Italy.\n[3620.64] Yes, yes, okay.\n[3621.44] Well now I think she's the Italian, yeah.\n[3623.20] I just thought it was like something that didn't like the pasta.\n[3626.24] Okay, hey, and it's like cheese and wine and stuff like that.\n[3630.08] It's not enough to be anti this thing.\n[3631.92] You gotta get your own thing.\n[3633.20] Now, this picture may have been the best one right here.\n[3636.48] Look at that.\n[3636.96] It's the worst Avengers movie ever.\n[3641.28] But to be clear, they were also getting ready for the evening's festivities.\n[3645.12] I want it.\n[3649.44] We figure we throw it in.\n[3651.12] That's cohesion, huh?\n[3652.08] Yeah, no.\n[3653.60] So, and we're going to get to you're wrong about everything here, and the references are all available link in the description.\n[3659.60] This means that legacy media, seeing the man who's not supposed to be respected by the international community being unilaterally respected by the international community, seeing the man who was supposed to be a feckless, ineffective celebrity president being incredibly effective and accomplishing what no other leader's been able to do for years.\n[3675.68] Um, well, that made them spurg, and that means that they're completely up in arms, uh, accusing Donald Trump of abandoning Europe, doing Putin's bidding, you know, the same tired talking points that don't really apply, but they still try and apply him.\n[3688.64] The president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, decided to have a meeting with him, and then decided to invite him to the United States of America.\n[3697.60] He didn't have to do that.\n[3698.80] And then you're showing it, rolled out literally a red carpet for him.\n[3703.20] Putin clearly won.\n[3704.48] There's no world in which Donald Trump he doesn't like multilateral meetings because he likes to be able to bully people on their own.\n[3709.92] It's unusual.\n[3711.28] All the stuff you just saw doesn't even happen for our democratic allies.\n[3714.88] Got a flyover, a red carpet, fly.\n[3716.96] A lot of handshakes.\n[3718.32] A lot of great state TV coverage back called.\n[3720.80] How many times have you seen any of our democratic allies or NATO allies or allies in Asia treated like that?\n[3727.20] It doesn't even have to be.\n[3768.32] From former U.S.\n[3769.28] Secretary of State and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, here's what she has to say.\n[3775.28] This post she just put out a short time ago.\n[3777.68] She says, if Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.\n[3788.32] Does this let me ask you this?\n[3789.44] Does this actually work on anybody?\n[3791.04] Does that kind of assholery work on anybody?\n[3794.24] If if without Ukraine ceding any territory, tell me when that's ever happened in the history of mankind.\n[3799.92] An inferior nation militarily, and if not for Western Mike coming to help them, coming to terms in a war that they're losing without compromising anything.\n[3810.72] Oh, okay.\n[3811.60] You're trying to set up a standard that could never possibly be met.\n[3814.48] And as the as for the man saying they're gonna gaslight.\n[3818.24] Do you mean like gaslighting in the way that you said these leaders wouldn't meet with Donald Trump in the way that you said these leaders have no respect for President Trump?\n[3828.08] Because we're going to get to the exact words from these leaders while they were all meeting on one side of the table with Donald Trump.\n[3835.36] And let's keep that in mind, the word gaslighting.\n[3837.60] It's time for why everything you say.\n[3841.12] You're wrong about everything.\n[3846.48] Wrong.\n[3847.76] All right, let's start with the left.\n[3849.52] So what they say is that Friday's meeting with Putin was stupid, pointless, and uh something.\n[3854.96] Well, I think last Friday, that Alaska summit was one of the most disastrous summits that I can think of.\n[3860.64] Oh no.\n[3861.44] Uh did no good in terms of advancing America's interests or the interests of our allies or Ukraine.\n[3867.60] And we treated this horrible dictator who terrorizes Ukrainians every single night, as you just showed by killing them through these attacks on civilians.\n[3877.92] Uh, we treated him like he was some special uh friend of the United States.\n[3882.08] Okay, here's the reality.\n[3883.76] Okay.\n[3884.96] The NATO Secretary General Mark Root thanked President Trump.\n[3888.48] He didn't say it's completely pointless, rolled out a red carpet.\n[3891.52] He thanked President Trump for being the only person in years to finally break the deadlock.\n[3899.68] His words.\n[3907.36] Basically, uh with President Putin by starting the dialogue.\n[3910.96] And I think it was in February that you had to first phone call, and from there, we are now where we are today.\n[3917.28] Uh and that is uh, I think if we play this well, we could end it.\n[3921.52] And we have to end it.\n[3922.56] We have to stop the killing, we have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure.\n[3926.88] It is a terrible war.\n[3928.48] Um, so I'm I'm really excited.\n[3930.80] By the way, that man's not a conservative as you would know it to be in the United States.\n[3935.20] So you have the left in the United States.\n[3937.12] This is not it's accomplished nothing.\n[3938.48] He's sucking up to him, and you have that man, the man who would know, thanking President Trump for breaking the deadlock.\n[3947.12] Does that sound like we're less respected in the international?\n[3950.24] You know who didn't break the deadlock?\n[3952.16] Biden.\n[3952.96] Here's another one.\n[3953.84] The left.\n[3954.56] They claim that President Trump is still sucking up to Putin.\n[3959.20] What the Europeans are coming to give Trump some support, some ballast.\n[3963.92] By the way, join Rumble Premium because we have to go.\n[3965.68] We're running late.\n[3966.16] If not, you're gonna see Tim Poole.\n[3967.52] Cut it.\n[3968.08] I mean, I'm not sure.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

you are unfamiliar with Adal, kind of like manual windows.\n[187.36] We realized that after yesterday's sketch, but I think you get it in principle.\n[191.12] Welcome uh viewers coming in from Vince.\n[193.12] Uh of course, Bon Gino Army.\n[194.80] We're glad to have you here.\n[195.52] I know that Bonino has some assistance over there at the uh the old FBI, which reminds me.\n[200.40] Is James Comey okay?\n[202.40] I mean, I know he's a cross dresser, tell everybody, but I don't know if he's okay when you see his latest video.\n[207.68] We're gonna talk about that today.\n[208.64] He's a swifty.\n[212.48] He's a swifty, and s and old Swift inspired him to stand up against Trump.\n[217.04] And by stand up against Trump, I mean lie about Donald Trump and try and destroy his career, his credibility, and his livelihood.\n[222.48] So we're gonna talk about that.\n[223.44] It's no small thing.\n[224.56] Chris Pratt was on with Bill Maher.\n[226.72] Um I like Chris Pratt.\n[229.76] There was a uh a black leftist.\n[233.36] Picture her in your head.\n[234.48] Yep.\n[236.08] On Jubilee, I think it's what is it called?\n[238.16] Uh surrounded with 20 black conservatives.\n[240.40] That's fun, and it shows you everything wrong with black liberalism today.\n[243.04] And hey, is there headway to be made?\n[244.40] That's my question to you.\n[245.68] Remember the black sit sort of uh or sorry, Blex it never really materialized.\n[249.68] And we saw a huge shift in Latino votes, Hispanic votes, where younger Hispanic men are now actually voting uh as a majority Republican block.\n[257.84] Do you see that oscillation that's never really shifted with the black American vote ever going Republican?\n[263.12] And I don't mean in social media world, I mean in the real world.\n[265.28] Then of course, most important President Trump uh had his meeting with Zelensky, and um the left wants us to fail, and by that, I mean they want more war.\n[276.00] Either you want President Trump to succeed, and he is right now.\n[278.80] We're making a lot of headway here, which is good for Americans, or you want him to fail, in which case you want perpetual war.\n[285.36] By the way, the next commercial you're about to see, it's a new sponsor.\n[288.24] There's a lot of legal stuff that had to be included at the end.\n[291.04] So we'll see.\n[293.20] Yeah, I thought that was a kid's pool toys, the squeakers.\n[299.44] Sound I'll never forget.\n[306.72] Oh, hey, scene is Would you just would you just drive up it?\n[311.60] I'm a Claren.\n[313.52] That's like a 200,000 dollar car.\n[316.16] But that one out there.\n[317.20] Well.\n[320.56] It's a $50,000 Rolex, Billy.\n[322.88] Yeah, I guess it is, yeah.\n[324.40] New suit.\n[325.52] Yeah, it's great, isn't it?\n[327.84] Weren't you and I just having a conversation last week about your credit score being shot?\n[333.36] Was that last week?\n[334.56] Last week.\n[335.52] Oh.\n[338.24] No, it's not anybody's guess.\n[340.16] This is what it is, Billy.\n[342.24] 200,000 car, a $50,000 watch, and I remani's suit.\n[347.44] It's a mystery.\n[348.40] No, there's no mystery.\n[349.44] Your credit score is shot because of these completely unnecessary lavish purchases.\n[354.64] Oh.\n[355.52] Download the the kickoff app.\n[357.20] We talked about it.\n[357.92] They they help build your credit fast.\n[360.72] If you do that, I don't know if they'll help you with this, but give it a sharp house.\n[366.72] Killer suit, though, right?\n[369.52] Stop.\n[371.44] Billy, what's going on with your butt?\n[373.76] What's going on with your butt?\n[375.92] This is the way God made me.\n[377.36] This great, right?\n[382.96] Yeah.\n[383.92] How much was that?\n[385.84] Twelve thousand dollars.\n[393.12] Yeah, I guess.\n[394.72] Check it out.\n[400.24] Users for credit under 600 ruin average of 84 points in their first year with on-time payments.\n[403.44] With transparent affordable plan starting at just five dollars a month, no hidden fee, zero interest.\n[406.08] Kickoff helps you score big when it comes to credit.\n[407.44] It's simple.\n[407.76] You make on time payments, credit bureau, see good behavior, and your credit can grow fast.\n[409.92] Start building credit with kickoff for as well as one dollar.\n[411.92] That's eight percent normal price.\n[412.80] When you go to get kick off.com slash crowder today.\n[414.40] That's kick off with the get kick off.com slash crowd.\n[464.24] Yeah, I bet you'll get a call, Gerald.\n[467.60] Here's the thing I will say.\n[469.04] I will say this kickoff, and it's one of the few products I wearing a couple of things.\n[472.00] It's one of the few products that I don't use because I have stellar credit.\n[475.20] But uh it's really useful and it works, but there's so much stuff that needs to be included.\n[479.28] We were like, do we re uh okay, all right, but I do recommend it.\n[482.24] If you have if you have credit, that's bad.\n[484.00] Hey, it'll help you.\n[484.96] I just I don't know how long this I don't know how long the sponsorship's gonna last.\n[488.72] I need a shirt, guys.\n[489.60] I got so screwed up by all this, I kept my normal shirt on.\n[493.44] All right.\n[494.32] Uh and let me ask you this also another Donald Duck.\n[498.00] What?\n[498.48] Oh yeah.\n[507.28] Still one of the hardest uh times I've ever left in my life was you voicing Donald Trump Donald Duck being raped.\n[515.28] By the way, I don't say that to be profane, that's an actual thing that Doug do.\n[518.24] They do it to establish a pecking order.\n[520.72] Established!\n[523.60] Oh yeah, I got a lake in front of my house, dude.\n[525.52] It's sex city out there.\n[526.64] Dude, there are not people think it's orgy town.\n[529.76] What was Toolman?\n[530.56] You just went to color bars?\n[531.52] What was that?\n[532.00] Yeah, that was uh I thought it was kind of cool.\n[533.68] Wrong.\n[534.16] Alright.\n[534.64] Can you admonish yourself?\n[536.08] Hey, the good news is you can tune in to this level of quality every weekday, 11 a.m.\n[539.36] Eastern.\n[540.08] Captain Morgan, CEO, I know you're well.\n[541.92] Friday and Saturday, August 22nd and 23rd in Portland, Oregon, Helium Comedy Club.\n[546.96] Uh Josh Eerstein looking uh looking very 90s-ish with the hair product down the middle, but it'll make sense.\n[552.08] I don't know.\n[555.68] Too late, bad.\n[556.32] It's this weekend, by the way, in Portland.\n[557.84] Yeah.\n[558.32] Yeah.\n[558.64] Yeah.\n[559.04] I thought you were saying it was this week in like a Dawson's Creek reunion.\n[562.08] That's also happening in Portland.\n[563.36] We're gonna burn down a precinct that's gonna be great.\n[565.12] I liked Pacey.\n[566.00] I love how by the way, one of the assistants just brought in another shirt for Gerald.\n[570.08] Because he's so I thought she was gonna I thought she's gonna come in.\n[575.44] I thought she was gonna come in and be like, uh, kickoff has kicked us off.\n[578.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[580.16] All right.\n[580.88] Uh while Gerald was getting changed.\n[583.04] By the way, nice traps.\n[584.64] Yeah, good traps on that guy.\n[586.64] Hair all over him.\n[587.36] It's a stuff of children's nightmares.\n[588.96] So let me ask you this before I move on.\n[591.04] Uh hey, uh, you know all cultures are equal.\n[593.92] Mm-hmm.\n[594.72] Hell.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[599.28] Ping.\n[590.16] This before I move on.\n[591.52] Hey, uh, you know, all cultures are equal.\n[594.72] Oh.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[600.16] Cow dung.\n[601.12] Can't be a luxury skincare.\n[602.88] Think again.\n[603.76] This is cowpeti's lavender and fun seed soap, a patented formula.\n[608.40] That is a pure genius.\n[610.08] Made from dry, beautified cow dung from indigenous cow blended with living.\n[614.72] Beautiful seeds and uh gotta be in indigenous cow dung.\n[619.44] DP hybrids and even helps heal skin issues like eczema wounds and mood.\n[624.88] It forms a legend.\n[626.56] Smells amazing from the start to finish, and outlaws so it says no paravents, no sulfates, no toxins, just clean seats gear.\n[637.20] Speak from nature.\n[638.32] Copetti wellness through mother go.\n[641.20] A couple of things that really are upsetting with that.\n[643.20] Number one is that someone will actually look at that and go, oh no, parabens.\n[646.56] That's good.\n[646.96] Yeah, you should be more concerned with the cow shit.\n[649.60] That's true.\n[650.24] I like that it's it says cowpathy, but she pronounces it cowpatty.\n[653.92] Yeah, exactly.\n[654.72] Yeah, I think that's very accurate.\n[656.16] She says outlast soap, but it sounds like outlaw soap.\n[660.24] This shower ain't big enough for the two of us.\n[663.28] And uh also when we say all cultures are equal, because here's the thing.\n[667.12] People will excuse this and go, oh, you know, yeah, cow dog.\n[669.36] First off, there's no there's no evidence that uh it will do anything other than make you smell like cowdung.\n[673.28] Second, you can't make those claims.\n[675.28] You understand that in the United States?\n[676.80] Like you can't, it will cure eczema, and it was starting the age.\n[680.32] Like she just says stuff.\n[681.76] And you can't say in the United States, you have to prove.\n[684.48] And I get it, we have a problem with the FDA, and there's a lot of red tape.\n[687.92] But for people out there who say all cultures are equal.\n[690.24] Do you also think that uh cultures are equal if only some cultures are allowed to make completely unsubstantiated medical claims?\n[696.88] What if someone out there with eczema thinks they're going to fix it with cow crap?\n[701.44] Is this why the trend of bleaching your skin is getting so big in India?\n[705.20] They're putting cow dung all over themselves, and they're like, oh, we gotta bleach that off.\n[708.40] That would make sense.\n[709.52] I like when they finally use soap, it has cow shit in it.\n[712.88] Yes, exactly.\n[714.96] So you can smell the way you want to.\n[716.88] That's right.\n[717.36] That's right.\n[717.84] Look!\n[719.28] Oh boy.\n[721.68] I just don't think that all cultures are equal.\n[723.76] And by that I mean some are bad and they'll remain bad, but it's a new trend.\n[727.76] This is a new trend, selling other cultures to the United States because it's novel, and it's not, or I should say India is not the only culture getting in on the action.\n[736.88] Hey, do you think that bird can't be a healthy hecka product?\n[741.92] Think again.\n[743.60] This is caca de pajaro.\n[745.76] It's made with the finest avocados, cilantro, and bird.\n[750.80] It's a sustainably sourced two in one shampoo and conditioner that will leave your hair feeling silky and smooth.\n[760.16] You look like a million pesos.\n[765.04] That's good luck.\n[766.40] Although he's basically saying you'll look like four dollar.\n[770.24] It's like it's like a thousand bucks.\n[772.64] It sounds impressive.\n[773.68] I don't think so.\n[774.48] Yeah, it is.\n[777.28] I'm gonna guess.\n[777.92] I'm gonna guess 1100.\n[779.04] Hey, great.\n[779.84] What is it?\n[780.40] All right.\n[783.84] 10 grand.\n[784.40] Because I'm American, and this place is better.\n[786.40] Yes, what's the number?\n[787.92] 53,189.\n[790.00] Whoa!\n[791.04] Coming up.\n[791.68] That's the new pay soon.\n[792.88] Hey, bro, you look like 53,489 dollars.\n[797.28] 93 cents.\n[798.16] Don't forget that, bro.\n[799.12] And bro, I round it up.\n[801.28] So get kick off.\n[804.32] Yeah.\n[807.68] Uh I'll tell you who needs to get kicked off the globe.\n[810.80] James Comey.\n[811.68] Well, that's impossible.\n[813.44] And I I this is it's it's funny, it's cringe inducing, and I warn you, this is like over a minute, and it's been cut down from six minutes.\n[822.24] But I remember I've told you this in the past where the left, they just they overuse the term gaslighting.\n[827.04] And the reason they use that is because that's what they do.\n[829.04] So James Comey, first off, he's a Swifty.\n[832.16] Okay.\n[832.48] And he talks about how being a Swifty uh allowed him to stand up to bullies like Donald Trump and gave him the strength.\n[838.64] Here's the thing.\n[839.44] We now know beyond any shadow of a doubt that there was spying on the Trump campaign, right?\n[844.16] That the Russia collusion hoax is just that a hoax.\n[846.96] It was fabricated and it was leaked to the media.\n[848.96] We we we know all of these things.\n[851.44] And he complains and talks about how Donald Trump was the only man who would come after me, and Donald Trump was the only man who I felt the need to record convert because I didn't trust.\n[859.76] What in reality he was part of a fabricated campaign to destroy a man's reputation, his ability to make a living, his family, his legacy.\n[871.12] And I would imagine that President Trump was probably aggressive and aggravated.\n[875.12] Hey, if you were in your workplace and there was an employee who was falsifying emails, pictures to try and get you fired, and to try sending them to your wife.\n[886.40] You were cheating on her, and you knew that it wasn't true, but people were believing it.\n[890.08] Everyone was.\n[890.80] Do you think he'd maybe be mad?\n[892.48] And do you think he'd maybe be a little aggressive with that guy?\n[895.20] And then would that man, James Comey, and this example in this example, would he be entitled to feign outrage and claim victim status?\n[904.24] That's what James Comey has done.\n[906.48] And that's why I believe that James Comey should face serious charges and jail time for his crimes.\n[912.32] But that's not what we're discussing today.\n[913.76] More important is that he's a Swifty, and he's been a fan of her since he was a fully grown man and she was 14.\n[919.60] Donald Trump is still president and still humiliating America on a national stage standing next to Vladimir Putin.\n[926.00] It's like a dream, a bad dream you can't wake up from.\n[929.76] But I don't want to talk about that bad dream this week.\n[931.92] I want to talk about a truly inspirational public figure named Taylor Swift.\n[935.52] This is a hostage.\n[936.56] Taylor Swift, and I go way back.\n[938.88] I went to my first concert of hers 15 years ago.\n[941.76] It was creepy then.\n[942.64] I've been to a second, and I have helped financially support the attendance of a lot of family members at others.\n[949.12] I'm in a family's Swifty group chat.\n[951.76] That's so sad.\n[952.64] I know all her music, and I listened to it in my headphones when I cut the grass.\n[958.88] Although honestly, for me, it's a tie between all too well, 10-minute version and exile, featuring Bonnie Vare.\n[965.92] At every stage of her career, she's shown a certain way of being that resonated with my kids.\n[971.44] Patya Lynn to me as a parent.\n[974.24] And she's still doing that as a grown-up.\n[977.92] Like a lot of you, I struggle with how to stand up to bullies without letting their meanness infect me and change me.\n[990.08] There are far more decent, honest, kind people in America than there are mean jerks.\n[996.56] And don't get me wrong.\n[997.76] We have our jerks, millions of them.\n[999.68] You can have noticed.\n[1000.80] Of course, we need to stand up to jerks and defend what matters.\n[1004.80] But I think we have to try to do that when you're like them.\n[1009.28] Which is what makes me think about Taylor Swift.\n[1012.56] She's made clear that she sees Donald Trump for what he is.\n[1015.92] And last year she urged Americans not to make the serious mistake of electing him.\n[1021.60] Of course, we're now living with the consequences of that mistake, but we know you were involved in a home.\n[1033.44] What's she doing?\n[1035.20] Living her best life.\n[1037.04] Producing great music and as she urged all of us to do during the podcast.\n[1042.00] Why?\n[1042.64] Not giving the jerks power over her mind.\n[1045.36] At my second Taylor Swift concert in Hartford tonight.\n[1050.96] She sang a song about it.\n[1052.80] Why does this exist?\n[1056.40] Why you gotta be so mean?\n[1057.76] And she spoke directly to the nasty people.\n[1060.08] Thank you, Taylor Swift.\n[1062.00] Keep the faith.\n[1063.28] I'm sure she'll take your advice to heart.\n[1066.40] First off, the lack of this reminds me of the you know of office space, Michael Bolton.\n[1071.28] Yeah.\n[1072.24] I celebrate his entire catalog.\n[1074.16] Like it's a joke, and he doesn't realize that it's a joke.\n[1076.16] Also, what you just saw is the problem of feminism personified.\n[1080.56] What do I mean?\n[1081.44] I mean valuing the wrong things.\n[1083.28] I mean valuing nice.\n[1084.48] Hey, Hitler was nice to kids.\n[1085.76] Osama bin Laden was nice to kids.\n[1087.60] You have plenty of horrible people who are nice.\n[1089.36] It's their actions that define them.\n[1091.84] Comey believes he's nice.\n[1093.28] Comey is underhanded, dishonest, and a man of no integrity.\n[1097.20] Who would you rather deal with?\n[1098.16] Someone who's rough around the edges, someone who sends out mean tweets, someone who tells you things that you don't like to hear, but you can count on to be the same person, or somebody who can't be relied upon to pick up your children from school, even if he gives you his word, but he does it with a smile.\n[1114.88] Feminism says nice matters.\n[1117.20] Patriarchy masculinity says that integrity, reliability, dependability, and discipline matters.\n[1125.12] If I have to pick, and Donald Trump is a very flawed man.\n[1127.52] If I have to pick a Donald Trump, or by the way, anyone like uh George Washington or a Jefferson or a Teddy Roosevelt over a Comey or Barack Obama type, I'm going with the strong man who may be a little tougher to deal with every single time.\n[1144.16] Yeah, you know who wasn't nice?\n[1145.36] Winston Churchill.\n[1146.48] That's why he was voted out only a couple years after he helped fight off the axis of evil.\n[1150.00] You know why?\n[1150.40] Because he wasn't nice enough to want socialized health care.\n[1153.92] So it's not a small thing.\n[1155.12] That is feminism personified.\n[1156.96] That is a weak, weak man, and weak men lie, and weak men are untrustworthy.\n[1163.12] And you know who loves weak men?\n[1165.20] Taylor Swift.\n[1166.48] It's clear as day.\n[1167.44] This isn't anything new, by the way.\n[1169.52] So I I don't want to be too harsh on him.\n[1171.44] Plenty of intelligence officials have taken uh cues and great influence from the pop stars of their time.\n[1177.12] Uh who can forget J.\n[1178.00] Edgar Hoover professing his undying love for share.\n[1181.04] Do you believe and of course there was the poorly received Joseph.\n[1180.24] Share.\n[1187.60] And of course, there was the poorly received Joseph McCarthy Ziggy Stardust era.\n[1192.56] This is God.\n[1197.92] And some were a swing and a miss.\n[1200.00] Who can forget the big flop with uh, of course, the head over there, Christopher.\n[1204.88] Uh baby, I was born this Ray.\n[1209.44] Rama Rama.\n[1211.36] The point is gay.\n[1214.32] All right.\n[1216.24] Uh.\n[1217.28] Hey, you know what?\n[1218.48] Uh, you could be a pastor somewhere with that effeminate kind of male thing going on.\n[1224.16] That's I I hate seeing that.\n[1226.16] Listen, it doesn't mean you have to, you know, be some guy that goes out and crushes beers on your skull or something like that.\n[1231.36] No, of course not.\n[1232.40] That's what I'm saying.\n[1233.84] Complaining about bullying when you're the head of the FBI at one point.\n[1237.12] Yeah.\n[1237.52] For four years, you were the head of the FBI and you're complaining about bullying?\n[1240.96] Here's the thing, too.\n[1241.60] That's that's a weird thing.\n[1243.04] It's really easy for them to act nice.\n[1244.48] Right, think about it.\n[1245.12] Everyone thought that Barack Obama was per hey, he's the kind of guy you want to have a beer with.\n[1248.40] By the way, best way to follow me is download the Rumble app, follow me there.\n[1251.28] You'll get this show where live weekdays at 11 a.m.\n[1253.36] Eastern.\n[1253.76] Don't be tied to an algorithm on social media.\n[1256.72] Think about this.\n[1257.36] He accuses Donald Trump of bullying.\n[1259.12] Donald Trump was a, no, wealthy?\n[1261.44] Sure.\n[1261.92] But we all know that wealth doesn't necessarily get you into office, right?\n[1265.04] As seen by spending more money than ever, the uh Kamala Harris campaign.\n[1270.00] Grey Ray, Christopher Ray, Barack Obama, and of course you can sort of add in Hillary Clinton.\n[1275.44] They all took part in a concerted campaign to spy on, destroy the reputation of and leak false information against one man who they didn't like.\n[1286.64] Can you think of any more clear example of bullying than that?\n[1290.24] Right.\n[1290.72] But because Donald Trump said, go screw yourself or whatever.\n[1294.16] We're supposed to believe he's the bully.\n[1295.76] The most powerful people on earth tried to secure their positions of power by as a gang bullying an individual they didn't like who, by the way, was supported by the American public.\n[1308.16] And just to be clear, and I know Ray, the timeline, he's he's gone after that.\n[1312.56] But after Donald Trump did win, they still trumped up a fabricated campaign to delegitimize him, knowing that it was false.\n[1323.28] They were bullying you.\n[1325.04] These people in position when people say it's a big club and you're not in it, they're talking about the Rays, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bidens.\n[1332.00] You understand that they're not talking about the Trumps.\n[1334.00] They're not talking about a real estate agent from New York.\n[1336.48] I can't think of a worse bully and a bully more corrosive to the American fabric.\n[1341.36] You want to know why you don't trust your institutions?\n[1343.36] The left wants to blame you when they want to create a department of misinformation.\n[1346.24] It's Christopher Ray.\n[1348.56] It's Comey.\n[1350.48] That's why you don't trust your institutions.\n[1352.56] And you shouldn't.\n[1354.32] Someone who probably understands where you're coming from.\n[1356.32] Chris Pratt was on Bill Mars uh show.\n[1359.52] Um not the HBO one that people watch, but the one that is entirely uh guest dependent.\n[1365.44] And it's true.\n[1367.92] I will say this.\n[1368.56] You can criticize Chris Pratt there because we all know that he's a uh a a Christian, and I would tend to guess that he leans more conservative, moderate, though he hasn't been super clear about that, but he's very clear about his faith.\n[1379.68] You could uh criticize him for being a fence sitter if you watch the clips, I think in full context, maybe maybe not.\n[1387.04] You could criticize him for being a little milk toast, maybe, but that's not why the left criticizes criticizes him on uh on his appearance on Bill Maher.\n[1396.32] They watched what you're about to watch, and people on the left believe that Chris Pratt is literally Hitler.\n[1402.16] Let's see.\n[1403.04] And in politics, you you inherit enemies.\n[1405.04] And when you jump on in in on, you know, the bandwagon with who is you know the most divisive president ever.\n[1413.12] It makes sense that you're going to be uh made to look terrible.\n[1420.08] And so I don't know what to believe.\n[1421.68] Because I it's not like I sit with Bobby and I go, so hey, let's talk about this.\n[1424.96] Let's talk about it.\n[1425.52] It's like we're just playing cards or playing mafia or having fun or having dinner.\n[1428.48] I'm not gonna pick his brain to find out exactly which of those things are true.\n[1431.04] I just kind of assume that none of them are.\n[1433.12] And for the most part, I wish him well, man.\n[1435.44] I hope that's kind of things that he uh oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way, like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food.\n[1445.04] I think that's a great thing.\n[1446.48] And so just if you just do that, that's amazing.\n[1449.60] I I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be have an allergic reaction to.\n[1457.36] To be like, oh, well, if they do it, I don't want it to happen.\n[1460.32] Um I'll feed my I'll put Clorox in my children's cereal myself.\n[1465.68] Come on, have some be reasonable here.\n[1467.52] There's certain things that would be a good thing to have.\n[1469.04] Uh I want them all to be successful.\n[1471.52] So you may say, like, ah, you know, hey, you could take that a little bit further, Mr.\n[1475.44] Pratt.\n[1476.00] No, I'm not saying that because that's not his job.\n[1478.08] He's an actor.\n[1478.88] Yeah.\n[1480.00] But the left is saying that was that was far enough.\n[1483.36] Did you hear what he said?\n[1484.40] That brings us to Reddit Retards.\n[1491.92] Bang him.\n[1493.28] And just in case you say I'm taking it out of contact.\n[1495.12] Go watch the entire interview.\n[1496.24] It's very similar to that in in tone.\n[1498.32] I would like it if Bill Marr let his guests speak a little more, but that's neither here nor there.\n[1501.60] Well, he was high, so we didn't know.\n[1503.28] So on Reddit, the responses to what you just saw.\n[1505.84] Best animator 182.\n[1508.08] The hatred is extremely reasonable, and Chris Rat.\n[1512.00] I like how they changed the name there.\n[1513.68] Is an idiot.\n[1514.72] There is nothing admirable about policies rooted in eugenics.\n[1520.24] Mentally retarded.\n[1522.00] Well, also no animations there.\n[1524.00] Uh kind of a fake name.\n[1525.84] Yeah.\n[1526.64] Yeah.\n[1526.96] Also, um, I think you might want to do a little bit, uh, a little bit of a uh a background check on eugenics.\n[1533.04] And particularly the history in the uh the 19th and 20th century.\n[1537.28] Not gonna like how it turns up, buttercup Kendall underscore with underscore one underscore L.\n[1543.68] Chris Pratt wants to kill all autistic people.\n[1547.44] Maybe she's retarded.\n[1548.80] No, actually, that was Margaret Sanger.\n[1550.32] Look into Planned Parenthood.\n[1551.52] Wow.\n[1551.84] She gotta change her name to two L's.\n[1553.28] Yeah, he wants to take out red dye from food.\n[1556.08] Or actually, I let me let me really represent Chris Pratt's position uh as accurately as I can.\n[1561.44] He doesn't want to be so mired in hatred that he blindly has to be angry about RFK Jr.\n[1567.52] doing something like removing a notable, a known toxin from children's cereal.\n[1574.16] Contrast that with Margaret Sanger, um, Planned Parenthood specifically wanted to eliminate any and all babies with birth defects.\n[1581.84] And by the way, also most black babies.\n[1584.00] Feisty underscore B 9175.\n[1587.44] What an idiot.\n[1588.72] Not surprising though.\n[1590.16] He is hyper religious and spouts Christian.\n[1593.28] That's corrected from the person who calls him an idiot.\n[1596.48] Bible verses publicly all the time.\n[1598.96] I put him up there, were I think with the other nut job has been actors like Dean Kane, Kevin Sorbo, and Jenny McCarthy.\n[1608.88] McCarthy.\n[1612.96] I've spent enough I've spent quite a bit of time with Dean Kane and Kevin Sorbo has been on the show.\n[1616.56] Uh I I know for certain that uh Dean Kane knows how to spell with.\n[1621.68] I mean, we can try.\n[1622.96] They were literally shaking typing on the comics at is it AI or Al.\n[1628.16] Some of us are old enough to remember the MAGA GOP hissy fits when Michelle Obama promoted healthier eating habits as first lady.\n[1635.28] Wonder what this Pratt had to say about that.\n[1638.32] I hate being retarded.\n[1639.84] Here's the thing.\n[1640.88] No one has a problem with somebody telling you to be healthier.\n[1644.80] The Michelle Obama campaign, right?\n[1647.76] The healthier school lunches were a complete failure again because it was predicated on the uh the idea that government could fix everything.\n[1653.12] The lunches were expensive, they were gross.\n[1655.20] Kids refused to eat them, so they just ended up trading them for other goodies and treats.\n[1659.36] It increased it waste.\n[1660.88] Kids were still hungry because they wouldn't eat the lunches.\n[1663.20] And by the way, it's at the same time as Barack Obama eliminated the presidential fitness test.\n[1667.28] So if you're going to say, hey, everyone, let's move more, let's be healthier.\n[1671.84] Great.\n[1672.40] Don't combine that with all body types are just as beautiful and healthy.\n[1676.08] And don't eliminate the presidential fitness test.\n[1678.08] It was about making people feel good no matter what they did, as opposed to being based on results.\n[1682.80] Also, the issue there is that she wasn't president and we're tired of the first lady's stupid pet projects.\n[1690.40] She's gonna stay busy.\n[1691.76] Yeah.\n[1692.88] The healthy school lunch program, just to be clear, it was about as successful and gross as Mexico's school lunch program.\n[1703.60] Muy delicioso.\n[1707.52] This has been Reddit Retards.\n[1716.64] Gerald, plug the merch store before we get to the blacks.\n[1719.20] Go to Crattershop.com right now to get this shirt, not the one that I was wearing a minute ago.\n[1723.36] There's only two genders or pro gun or pro cow poop.\n[1727.28] I don't think we have a pro cow poop.\n[1728.56] No, I'm very anti.\n[1729.68] Probably find one as a general rule.\n[1731.60] I don't know.\n[1731.92] We'll see.\n[1732.32] Pro dung.\n[1732.96] Yeah.\n[1733.36] Crowder shop.com.\n[1734.32] Find something cool.\n[1734.96] Good word, by the way.\n[1736.40] We had one employee here who literally smelled like cow poop.\n[1739.12] Really?\n[1739.60] Yeah, it was short-lived.\n[1740.56] Oh, we don't know.\n[1741.36] You know, you remember.\n[1743.36] So I don't want to get into too much detail.\n[1748.00] Uh it was I will tell you this.\n[1750.48] Look, look, for as much as people like love to bitch about the boss, we had to have meetings on how to approach uh a person who smelled so bad that other employees were complaining without hurting their feelings or sort of stepping on a legal liability landmine.\n[1766.00] Do you have any idea how difficult that is?\n[1767.92] When you have a you have employees threatening to quit because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.04] Yes.\n[1770.24] Because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.12] Yes.\n[1779.52] How about uh you start a prank war.\n[1781.04] Uh-huh.\n[1781.52] Tell them what's a prank war, and then they're the only one that gets pranked.\n[1784.32] And it's like they walk through a door and you know, soap falls on it.\n[1788.08] Yes.\n[1788.32] So they hit a tripwire as they walk by their desk, and then Fabrizio just goes.\n[1794.24] Yes, exactly.\n[1795.20] They behind a door and it's just a tool chest.\n[1797.20] Like, what was that?\n[1798.00] It was the sound of 5,000 bars of ivory coming down to stairs.\n[1802.96] I prayed to you.\n[1803.92] I covered your seat in dryer sheets.\n[1806.16] Yeah.\n[1807.36] It was uncomfortable.\n[1808.72] Speaking of uncomfortable.\n[1810.64] Guys, I did take a shower.\n[1812.88] So uh let me ask you this.\n[1814.64] Can you identify, and I'm not talking about talking heads.\n[1817.12] I'm not talking about people who are uh just in the space where they they revolve around political commentary.\n[1821.76] Can you identify a major black celebrity who's conservative?\n[1826.88] I heard Denzel Washington.\n[1828.72] Uh no, he's he's he's voted Democrat, he's a Christian, and he encourages accountability, but doesn't fully connect the dots.\n[1834.48] And by the way, I from everything that I've seen and heard like Denzel Washington, we probably would disagree on some issues politically.\n[1841.04] Uh another question for you do you think there's ever going to be a point where the scales tip?\n[1846.88] Because we saw it with Hispanic votes.\n[1848.48] We saw it with Gen Z.\n[1849.68] We've never seen it to a significant degree with black votes in America.\n[1852.64] And we have more black representatives or commentators uh than ever.\n[1857.52] You know, back when we were growing up, you pretty much had Thomas Sowell and kind of Larry Elder.\n[1861.84] Um Alan Keyes, Herman King Alfonso Rachel was an early and OG.\n[1865.76] I'd recommend go checking him out on YouTube.\n[1867.44] He was one of the first people there.\n[1868.72] But now you have a ton of people.\n[1870.16] The Blexit never really materialized.\n[1872.80] Do you think that it'll ever happen?\n[1875.36] Comment.\n[1877.68] And uh I I also understand why it's so um it's so tipped uh towards one side uh as far as politically with black people, because if you look or listen to anything in media, um, you will only see black celebrities assuming that you must be.\n[1900.16] You must be, unless you're a traitor, uh, liberal if you're black.\n[1905.92] We are voting for the right to choose what happens to our own bodies.\n[1912.64] We are damn black bitch.\n[1914.96] I choose you ourselves from this precipice of danger.\n[1920.40] Well, I misspelled respect.\n[1922.64] And a lot of these cake corrected me in a hashtag.\n[1929.36] Now I want y'all to help me correct President Trump to teach him what it means.\n[1934.48] Ladies and gentlemen, please.\n[1937.04] Nice haircut.\n[1937.92] Big loud Texas, welcome to the next president of the United States.\n[1945.28] Come on.\n[1946.80] You think that this guy has done stuff for black people.\n[1951.84] All I gotta say is crack is whack.\n[1955.84] I'm not trying to be funny.\n[1957.52] Well, mission accomplished.\n[1958.88] Nothing has never done enough for black folks.\n[1961.60] Thank you for all that.\n[1962.32] It's a double negative.\n[1963.12] That means he's done something.\n[1964.08] I know you guys are excited to see her.\n[1965.60] I didn't know you guys would be excited to see me too.\n[1967.60] But uh Yeah.\n[1969.68] I gotta go disappear to what I call training camp for a few weeks, come back with a bolts butt and ten new pounds of muscle.\n[1975.20] Now this brings us to uh the uh I keep wanting to say outnumbered, the surrounded, which for those of you who are unfamiliar, it's basically change my mind with a vote timer.\n[1986.88] Um it is, it really is.\n[1989.60] And this is one black radical.\n[1992.08] This is uh an actress, Amanda Seals, uh, versus 20 black um conservatives.\n[1997.44] Now, here's the thing.\n[1998.08] I w uh we're going to get into some of the claims versus the reality.\n[2002.48] Um, but this is important to to note, it's a technique that's used a lot.\n[2007.28] And I've encountered it in Change My Mind quite a bit.\n[2009.60] And right, Change My Mind was just sit down, establish uh the premise, which they refer to as a prompt, and anyone can sit down and you know, change your mind.\n[2018.88] Okay.\n[2019.76] You've seen people do this where what they do is the in betweens.\n[2023.04] If they know their argument doesn't really hold any water, they try and taint it with things like, you know, oh, you're unreasonable, or ugh, I can't believe these people must be paid actors.\n[2033.20] Or ugh, they try if their argument doesn't hold water, they try and tip those scales on a it's performance art.\n[2040.16] So as bad as you thought this was going to be with Amanda Seals, it's much worse.\n[2045.36] I'm not sure where your education came from, but they lied to you.\n[2048.80] I hope some of y'all are acting.\n[2050.40] I really do.\n[2051.68] I knew I was gonna be surrounded by ignorance, but damn, let's go.\n[2054.96] And my points are just as valid as yours, even though you got a pocket square and a church of Christ uh pin on your chest.\n[2061.28] Whatever.\n[2061.92] It's a cross, same difference.\n[2063.12] You got an American flag and you think you know something because you a cop.\n[2065.60] And ultimately not a cop, this much of it.\n[2067.60] It's a it's a cab all day over here.\n[2069.36] So let me make that clear.\n[2071.76] But you're literally speaking this.\n[2073.28] And you're not going to do that with me either.\n[2074.56] So you're stating your point.\n[2076.08] Y'all just want to be seen.\n[2077.44] I don't need to be seen.\n[2078.40] You're coming.\n[2078.96] That's why you're dressed like a poison dart frog.\n[2082.08] Just like she fell in the four buckets of the chimney or not.\n[2084.48] I have not had, you know, first of all, you're a light skin woman.\n[2087.84] So are you?\n[2088.48] Yes, and you're doing great cell.\n[2090.96] Yes, and so colorism really does serve us.\n[2094.00] This is scary.\n[2095.04] You need to think about me as your mama.\n[2096.88] Do not talk to me in that fashion.\n[2098.48] So let's check that now.\n[2100.16] See, and this is what happens too.\n[2101.68] Sometimes I refer to tone policing, but she's telling some, you need to do this.\n[2106.72] Now, I don't mean it's it's very reasonable to require someone if you are offering them respect to be respectful.\n[2112.48] Like, hey, I didn't, and I've done this.\n[2114.00] Hey, you know, I let you finish.\n[2115.36] Yeah.\n[2115.68] Uh you gotta let me finish.\n[2117.76] Or occasionally I'll go, you know what?\n[2119.76] I'm going to finish uh my thought as though you're an adult capable of giving the same respect I've given you.\n[2125.92] But that's not what she's doing.\n[2126.80] She's like, you need to think of me like yo mama.\n[2129.76] How entitled can you be?\n[2131.84] You don't get to tell someone what to think or how they should view you.\n[2135.20] Here's how someone's going to view you, usually.\n[2137.60] It's usually going to be based on your actions.\n[2141.20] And in this case, your words, your stupid, stupid words.\n[2145.84] So seals, just to give you an idea, was at the center of quite a few uh controversies herself.\n[2151.28] For example, defending Jesse Smollett, quote, even if it was a hoax.\n[2155.68] What?\n[2156.24] Yeah, this is someone who just if black people can do no wrong.\n[2159.92] Even if it was a hoax and cost taxpayer dollars in the and the city, and even if it did stir racial division and hatred, you know, another hoax too, like Michael Brown, hands up, don't shoot.\n[2169.68] Jesse Smallett's funny.\n[2171.04] Black lives matter, the terrorism, the billions of dollars in damage.\n[2174.00] That was also a hoax.\n[2176.00] So she was also kicked out of a black Emmy party.\n[2178.40] She got into a feud with a black sorority, and she claimed that she was autistic without ever actually being diagnosed, which is funny, but hey, it's not just black white.\n[2186.64] That's feminism to the letter.\n[2188.80] Just claim victim status, and you assume you win the argument, but that doesn't fly here.\n[2193.84] It's time for claim truth.\n[2199.44] Can we go back claiming autism as a tool in an argument?\n[2204.24] That's real retarded, sir.\n[2205.60] Sure.\n[2206.00] Yeah, it's a it's a it's a thing that a lot of people do.\n[2208.64] Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n[2209.92] The only person who never will is Al Sharpton who spells respect with two K's.\n[2215.36] Respect.\n[2216.32] I misspell respect.\n[2217.60] It's crazy.\n[2218.16] That was actually very revealing.\n[2219.20] Because to me, I just thought it's the way he speaks.\n[2220.88] No, in his mind, he's going, R E S P E KK, that is what it means to me.\n[2226.32] Yeah, there's a whole song.\n[2228.32] I don't know.\n[2229.28] I don't think I would ever get to the point in an argument where I'm like, but I'm retarded.\n[2233.04] Yeah.\n[2233.76] Well, you don't need to say it.\n[2234.72] I don't think you said in an argument, I think she was just claiming it.\n[2236.80] She's claiming it.\n[2237.52] Yeah, but why?\n[2238.24] Anyway.\n[2238.80] Because it's a status symbol to say.\n[2240.32] It's a victim.\n[2241.28] It is.\n[2241.60] It's like I'm a marginalized group.\n[2244.64] I'm I'm not only am I black, but I'm also a woman.\n[2247.20] And not only that, but I'm on the lowest end possible of being retarded.\n[2250.96] Yeah.\n[2251.20] No, no, no.\n[2251.68] I don't know.\n[2252.08] I I get it, but then you try to put yourself out there as somebody who can articulate the points of why reparations are a thing.\n[2258.00] Like you've basically just under, oh, so I don't need to listen to you.\n[2261.12] No, no, no.\n[2261.76] I understand you're being logical.\n[2262.96] That's your problem.\n[2263.84] Is if you take away victim status.\n[2265.76] Right.\n[2266.16] If you completely remove it.\n[2267.04] Okay.\n[2267.28] In other words, if you don't go, wait, black, white, okay, well, hold on a second, um, white woman, black guy, what uh trans, okay, disabled.\n[2274.00] Right.\n[2274.32] If you take all of that away, you actually have to um rest on the the validity of your arguments.\n[2282.16] Your actual thoughts.\n[2283.20] Yeah.\n[2283.52] Your opinions.\n[2284.16] So if you take all of the identity politics away, it just comes down to actions, performance, arguments, claims.\n[2293.28] We can't have that, and we certainly don't have that in the public school system.\n[2296.32] So the first claim uh that's made systemic ra and this has been addressed in changed my mind well over half a decade ago.\n[2306.08] Actually, systemic racism, by the way, challenge is still out there of one example today in the 21st century.\n[2311.04] Systemic racism is real, says the self-diagnosed retard.\n[2314.96] Ultimately, systemic racism exists in our institutions on a government level in our institutions, whether it's prisons or schools, and it is undeniable because they are actively trying to reinstate it right now.\n[2329.44] Okay.\n[2330.08] So the truth, it's hard to deal with claims that make no sense.\n[2334.72] I don't know what you mean by trying to reinstate it.\n[2336.40] And I watched the whole thing, and it still doesn't make sense.\n[2338.48] Uh blacks are completely proportionally represented in Congress, right?\n[2341.52] In government, okay, about 14%.\n[2343.68] And uh, as far as prison, now again, her premise, but again, she's she's on the spectrum according to her, is just black people are being put there because they're black.\n[2351.52] Black people in this country, despite making up twelve to thirteen percent of the population commit over half of all the violent crimes.\n[2358.08] And then if you look at wait systemic discrimination, okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students.\n[2360.00] Okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students who are woefully underqualified in some cases, they do.\n[2373.92] They do get in.\n[2374.72] DEI exists.\n[2377.20] And here's the thing, too.\n[2378.08] When she goes on to talk about reparations, they act as though those things have never taken place.\n[2383.12] DEI is reparational.\n[2384.40] Affirmative action is reparations.\n[2385.76] Model Cities program is reparations.\n[2387.92] EBT, SNAP, the baby mama that was created by these are reparations.\n[2391.68] Section 8 housing, more money into public school.\n[2394.32] These are reparations that have been paid to the tune of trillions of dollars and have made nothing better.\n[2400.64] Now she may say those aren't the reparations we want, but those are the reparations that exist because it's what their party and what their community, the black community, have demanded.\n[2408.96] They petitioned, they got these reparations, and it didn't work.\n[2415.04] The answer, if you ask them, so when is it enough is always more.\n[2419.60] Here's the next claim that she makes.\n[2423.12] And this is a tough one.\n[2424.24] I don't even know.\n[2424.88] It's like grabbing a bar of soap.\n[2426.64] Uh soap.\n[2428.08] Which kind of soap, yeah.\n[2429.52] Done so.\n[2430.56] Harriet Tubman was uh actually aided by white supremacy something.\n[2436.40] I refuse to embrace a victim mentality because that's not what our grandparents and Harriet Tugman and those people fall for.\n[2442.96] They fought for whatever.\n[2444.00] Do not bring that Harriet Tubman's name in vain, baby.\n[2447.52] Please name in vain.\n[2451.20] Harriet Tubman was literally, literally saving her family and others from slavery.\n[2460.00] Yeah.\n[2460.80] You know who helped her white people.\n[2462.64] You know who helped her.\n[2463.68] They were on the underground railroad.\n[2465.04] No, no, no, no, you know, helped her.\n[2466.96] Come on, even though you know who helped her?\n[2469.44] Guy.\n[2470.16] And there are people who benefit from white supremacy.\n[2473.36] What?\n[2474.40] That guy had answers.\n[2475.60] Yeah, he did.\n[2476.64] He did.\n[2477.52] Uh, okay, so the truth to this one.\n[2481.52] I uh uh okay.\n[2483.76] So here's my understanding of her uh of her uh again, self-diagnosed uh autistic argument is that um white people helped Harriet Tubman, but they could only help her because they were beneficiaries of white supremacy, therefore white supremacy helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2499.60] Okay, so you don't want allies.\n[2502.48] Get it done with 12% of the population.\n[2505.44] I would help, but I benefit from white supremacy.\n[2508.40] Everyone in this room, by the way, you're precluded from helping because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2512.40] Tell that to the Quaker Church who helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2515.20] Yeah.\n[2515.76] Tell it to Massachusetts Governor uh John Andrew.\n[2518.96] Tell it to the multiple whites who helped with the underground railroad specifically, just to be clear.\n[2524.56] No, no, no, you guys all have to stop because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2528.56] Oh, so the slaves should do it on their own.\n[2531.04] This is a way of removing any and all credit for the good deeds that white people have committed.\n[2538.00] In the name of I know this is inconvenient.\n[2540.32] Modern Christianom.\n[2541.76] Yeah.\n[2542.40] I don't understand what what this point like if you didn't have white people, nobody would know about Harriet Tubman.\n[2548.08] You know why?\n[2549.04] She wouldn't have made it.\n[2550.08] We wouldn't let you write books about it, and you wouldn't be free.\n[2553.04] Mm-hmm.\n[2553.84] So maybe just saying thank you.\n[2556.24] You know who else is the benefit uh who's benefited from white supremacy?\n[2559.52] Um, the wealthiest celebrities on earth.\n[2561.92] There you go.\n[2562.48] Beyonce, NJZ, the top box office draws of the night, the uh Will Smith of the world, the Denzel Washington's of the world, the three most recognizable faces on earth in the 90s, Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson, kind of, that's a half one, Mike Tyson.\n[2576.08] Because white people you know who else?\n[2577.44] Barack Obama, president of the United States.\n[2579.28] I know that one's pretty crazy.\n[2580.72] That's rough.\n[2581.44] Also, white people, the ones who've given you the platform to speak these kinds of asinine opinions uh in a show like surrounded, not outnumbered.\n[2592.00] Surrounded.\n[2592.56] The next claim that she makes.\n[2595.28] That blacks absolutely do need reparations, and she's gonna make an airtight case.\n[2600.24] Now, let me land the plane.\n[2601.52] We're talking about reparations, and what you're doing is actually female pilot.\n[2606.32] The fact is reparations are just and necessary because on a basic level, black people built this country, and the country continues to thrive off of the labor that black people put into this country, and it would behoove you, young man, to really understand the way that your ancestors put blood, sweat, and tears into this nation that is still living off of those blood, sweat and tears.\n[2628.80] Okay, and I'll open this up to you guys, but here's the truth.\n[2630.72] All right, couple of things.\n[2631.76] I just addressed this, right?\n[2632.88] When you talk about EBT snap, section eight housing, more money to public schools, when you talk about affirmative action, DEI.\n[2638.32] These are all forms of reparations, to be clear.\n[2640.88] I think at some point she says repatriations.\n[2642.56] I'm not entirely sure she kind of delineates between the two.\n[2644.80] Remunerations.\n[2645.52] Is that what she says?\n[2646.08] Yeah, remunerations, sorry.\n[2647.36] Renumerations.\n[2648.48] Um.\n[2651.04] And she'll say, well, that's not what now we're asking for money.\n[2653.52] Okay, great, but those things exist because your community and the Democrat Party said that those were required.\n[2660.40] Okay?\n[2661.04] Those were required.\n[2662.00] That's the rep to the tune of trillions of dollars.\n[2664.88] Why is that not enough?\n[2666.16] And by the way, why do reparations need to be paid to a 15-year-old black guy?\n[2672.24] What kind of reparations does Jesse Smallett deserve?\n[2675.12] And is it wiped out by what he costs the good good taxpaying citizens of Chicago?\n[2680.96] I know you say you should defend him anyway because it's just a hoax.\n[2683.68] Oh, that's right.\n[2684.40] Now I'm getting it.\n[2685.44] The answer is always more money, please, more money, please.\n[2688.88] You asked for reparations.\n[2691.28] You may not like them now.\n[2692.56] It's what you asked for.\n[2694.64] You got them.\n[2696.64] You're saying it's not enough.\n[2698.88] Now you're on your own.\n[2700.40] The other thing is, by the way, I'm so tired of this.\n[2702.96] All references available, link in the descriptions.\n[2705.60] Um blacks built this country.\n[2708.08] No, they didn't.\n[2709.44] No, they didn't.\n[2710.64] In comparison to the labor in this country, and certainly in comparison to the businesses created and the innovations uh in this country, and yes, manual labor, especially if you look at the industrial revolution.\n[2722.48] You look at these great booms that took place in this country.\n[2725.28] It is not because of black people.\n[2728.56] They took part in it, but not any greater part than any well.\n[2732.72] 75%, by the way, of Southerners didn't own any slaves whatsoever.\n[2735.76] States like California never had any slaves, to be clear.\n[2738.96] And while we're talking about this, the vast majority of slaves, anywhere from 90% to 96%, I think the high number, 96% comes from Cornell West.\n[2747.68] Uh, they were sold into slavery by West African slave traders.\n[2752.40] Also, if you want to go buy yourself a slave today, you can still do it in plenty of African nations.\n[2757.76] You're gonna be dealing with a black person, though, so don't be surprised.\n[2761.36] Here's the next part of this is um slavery, too, actually can be argued through the metrics, it held the country back.\n[2770.00] The free North outperformed the South while they still had slaves in every way you could measure economically.\n[2778.08] The cotton industry exploded after slavery ended.\n[2781.52] Innovations like the cotton gin that came from the areas of the country that didn't have slavery.\n[2786.08] So this is something, and it's something that used to it's used to guilt white people.\n[2789.76] You wouldn't have this country if not for black people.\n[2792.08] Okay, well, black people, Africans who were sold by their African brothers.\n[2796.56] Hey, they're still there in countries in Africa.\n[2799.36] What does that look like?\n[2801.84] What's the difference?\n[2804.00] You have Africans and both.\n[2806.40] They're slaves in both.\n[2808.96] Slavery's wrong, to be clear, just like Hitler, bad.\n[2811.92] Africans in both slavery and slave owners alike in both.\n[2816.24] Pick a country, any country.\n[2818.64] The African continent, United States.\n[2820.56] What's the difference?\n[2821.52] Who built the country?\n[2824.08] One of the most infuriating things that she does is she makes these claims as though they're self-evident, right?\n[2829.20] She just says, yes, systemic racism exists.\n[2831.52] We were trying to think about, okay, well, how do you combat that without going down 50 rabbit holes?\n[2835.28] Okay, we'll go with what she said.\n[2836.40] Government prisons and schools.\n[2837.60] Okay, well, you can't prove that because we just disproved that.\n[2840.32] Reparations are absolutely just and needed.\n[2842.64] Okay, well, how do you prove that?\n[2844.08] Who gets it?\n[2845.04] Right.\n[2845.60] These people, we built this country, therefore, she goes to the next point as though that foundational statement is true.\n[2852.00] I just wish she would say something with some kind of factual backing.\n[2856.40] Quote a study, even if I don't agree with it, just something, a stat.\n[2860.00] Give me a number to go after.\n[2861.76] In fact, when the guy brought up statistics about black on black crime, she goes, stats lie all the time, honey.\n[2867.20] If you're gonna make your argument about stats, you already lost.\n[2870.08] Yeah.\n[2870.48] It's exactly what she did.\n[2871.44] It's like, oh, so I will never ever, you're just a racist person.\n[2874.64] Yeah.\n[2874.96] That's really what we're dealing with.\n[2876.08] They're a racist person who hates this country.\n[2878.24] Fantastic.\n[2878.88] Here's an offer from me.\n[2880.48] Not this show, from me personally.\n[2882.24] I will write you a check right now to pay to have you move to Africa.\n[2885.28] Let me Because apparently you don't like it here.\n[2887.20] Yeah.\n[2887.52] Let me ask you.\n[2888.08] I don't want to be, I don't want to be an oppressor.\n[2889.60] No, no, none of us do.\n[2890.48] Let me ask you this.\n[2891.04] If you went to Harriet Tubman back in time and said, hey, look, you can you can tomorrow, slavery is done.\n[2897.28] You don't have to do this railroad stuff.\n[2898.96] Okay, it's done.\n[2900.08] It's over.\n[2900.72] This railroad stuff.\n[2901.60] Everyone will be free.\n[2902.72] Everyone will be free.\n[2903.76] Oh, that's malarkey.\n[2905.04] But that's it.\n[2905.52] It's a fresh start.\n[2906.24] The only way we know how to do this, Miss Tubman, you've inspired us, is to break these chains.\n[2910.88] Slavery is done, but we just got to get a fresh start.\n[2912.80] We can't keep looking to the past.\n[2914.00] It's over.\n[2914.48] Everyone's free.\n[2915.68] Do you think of course she would take that deal.\n[2917.76] And if she saw seal, she would tell her to get a haircut and sew up the holes in her genes.\n[2921.60] Here's a bonus claim that she makes that uh just sort of shows that she's an actual racist.\n[2927.04] If you didn't know that by her defending Jesse Smollett because of his blackness, uh the claim here is that the Chinese aren't actual minorities or something like black people.\n[2936.32] I don't know.\n[2936.96] For example, we have the uh Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n[2939.68] We prevented Chinese people from getting citizenship and even entering the country, we discriminate against them, and basically put them under apartheid, even here in the United States.\n[2947.68] Yet they have the highest median household income.\n[2949.52] How is that possible?\n[2950.56] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to pay for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time?\n[2957.20] Which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2950.64] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to beg for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time, which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2960.32] Oh, young Matt.\n[2961.60] One, comparing Chinese people who are immigrants that made a choice to come to the United States and comparing the continued effort of black people to ground themselves in a nation that continues to make impediments for them to show and live and exist in their true citizenship is a false equivalency.\n[2979.28] I don't believe that happens at all.\n[2980.24] What a what no one here is in the world?\n[2982.16] Are you acting right now?\n[2983.12] Do you really believe that?\n[2984.80] There's a way to try and discredit the person.\n[2986.88] Yeah.\n[2987.60] Now, before I get to the truth, let me just tell you this.\n[2989.68] I'm also, I think that you're placating by saying black people kill black people in record numbers.\n[2994.80] Because that's a you know what I'm actually really concerned with?\n[2997.92] I'm also really concerned with the fact that black people kill white people in this country in record numbers.\n[3002.40] It's not just your community's problem.\n[3004.64] No.\n[3005.28] And we have a right to an opinion because we are several times more likely to be assaulted, to be mugged, to be robbed, or to be killed by a black person as a white American than by a white American.\n[3015.20] Yep, the numbers are even higher because of the proximity effect of black people living around other black people.\n[3020.08] But let's be honest about this.\n[3022.40] We're concerned that we're more likely to be the victim of crime, and you can't blame it on there not being enough affirmative action.\n[3030.80] Anyone want to c anyone agree with that?\n[3032.64] I'm tired of going, oh, the black on black crime, they're the biggest yeah, sure, they're the biggest threat to the black community.\n[3037.44] I'm very concerned with them being a threat, that community to my white children.\n[3042.00] Got it.\n[3042.64] That's a great point because in this the the longer version of the video, you know, other people brought that up.\n[3049.04] And it is a real concern.\n[3050.40] But she her response was uh, well, how many how many black people do you see uh in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3056.32] A lot.\n[3056.64] How many white people do you see in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3058.96] Uh some.\n[3059.76] Well, uh that well, then that's not that's why.\n[3061.60] That's you're not you're not in danger from white people because you don't see white people.\n[3064.48] Yeah, yeah.\n[3065.12] The only problem is if you look at the armed robbery, you look at the burglaries, you look at the violent crime taking place in the white neighborhoods, you know, the next town over, you still see the same stats.\n[3075.20] In other words, these gangs of largely black people, they travel.\n[3080.08] And we have a problem with it.\n[3081.52] Brown round get around, they get around.\n[3084.24] The browns, browns, browns, browns, they get around.\n[3088.24] Shh.\n[3090.48] But here's the truth.\n[3091.84] Uh the Chinese in the United States.\n[3094.32] It's not a false equivalent.\n[3095.36] See, they weren't even considered citizens until 1943.\n[3098.24] 1870.\n[3099.44] Wow.\n[3099.76] Is when the 15th Amendment gave black men the right to vote, to be clear.\n[3104.16] 1920, the 19th Amendment, some would say a mistake granted black women the right to vote.\n[3109.12] Not because they're black, all women.\n[3110.88] And uh today, yes, the median income for Chinese Americans is 82,000 versus 54,000 for black Americans.\n[3117.68] So they've been discriminated against far more recently, in a way that would negatively affect their income.\n[3121.92] They bounce back.\n[3123.36] And by the way, richer than the average German, just to be clear.\n[3126.72] Like the Chinese do really well.\n[3128.72] You keep saying it wrong.\n[3130.08] The Chinese.\n[3130.88] Thanks.\n[3131.20] Sorry, it's pronounced Chinese.\n[3132.48] Finally admonish me.\n[3133.60] Yes.\n[3133.92] Admonish him alone.\n[3134.88] I don't want to be ethnocentric.\n[3136.72] Do it a lot.\n[3138.64] Chinese go down with the ship, Jim.\n[3141.04] And by the way, these metrics show you uh they Chinese, they know dumb.\n[3143.84] They are doing very well.\n[3146.48] So I don't know why it's plural in other countries, but it is.\n[3148.72] Hey, so what let's let's just concede the argument that she makes right now.\n[3152.16] I just want to concede every single point, right?\n[3153.84] I know we don't want to do that, but let's just concede.\n[3155.68] Every single thing you say about white people in this country, white supremacists and Harriet Tubman, systemic racism everywhere.\n[3162.00] You're right, you're owed every single dollar in my bank account.\n[3165.04] Do you think that's going to happen?\n[3167.76] And is that the best advice for all of your constituents to try to get that?\n[3172.72] Or let's just say that they're an oppressive system that they can never get out of, which is kind of what you're claiming in the first place.\n[3178.08] Wouldn't it be better to do what the other cultures have done and just try to make the very best of it that you possibly can and try to fix that instead of just complaining and shaking your fist at the sky and saying every bad thing that happens to you is because of the white man keeping you down?\n[3191.60] That's what works.\n[3192.88] You don't care about your community.\n[3194.48] Yeah.\n[3194.80] You care about having a grievance.\n[3196.40] You care about having an excuse for failure.\n[3199.60] Right.\n[3200.24] Instead of saying, hey, we need more fathers in the home in this community.\n[3204.16] Hey, we need less violence in this community.\n[3206.00] Hey, we need better education in this community.\n[3208.08] And guess what?\n[3208.96] Those people aren't gonna give it to us.\n[3210.64] Fine.\n[3211.12] We're gonna do it ourselves.\n[3212.32] Yeah.\n[3212.72] I tell you who really wants preparations.\n[3215.20] Chrysler.\n[3216.24] Oh, I thought you said pre I thought you said preparations, and I was thinking it's big H.\n[3220.48] No.\n[3221.36] No.\n[3221.84] Reparations.\n[3223.44] I'm not gonna say it.\n[3224.16] And by the way, bring up a bonus uh for uh those who are members of Rumble Premium for Mug Club.\n[3228.16] By the way, if you're not click that button below, we'll go on for another hour.\n[3231.44] Uh it's 99 dollars, you get everything ad-free, you get 100% more show, including the Friday show, and uh it's the only thing that keeps the lights on, or try for 999 a month, where they talked about with her uh black culture, and they talked about hip hop and the things that were glorified, and she said, Well, who's the one feeding black people that?\n[3248.48] Who's the one so if if they're force feeding you junk food, and in other words, it's white people who are largely responsible for the mass consumption in the black community and rejection by the way of any and all other forms of media as it relates to gangster culture as it relates to decadence and hedonism that you see.\n[3267.84] Um, I would have loved to ask her, what's on your playlist?\n[3271.36] Yeah.\n[3272.48] What do you think's on Jesse Smollett's playlist?\n[3274.80] Why have you been dubbed duped by the evil white man?\n[3278.08] I'm guessing Jew, right?\n[3279.36] Why have you been duped?\n[3281.68] It is our fault.\n[3282.56] Yeah.\n[3282.88] We men of the bucket and the mop.\n[3284.64] Yes.\n[3285.28] Yes.\n[3286.16] Yeah.\n[3286.88] It's uh, which is after which she modeled her hairdo.\n[3290.16] Um was the other thing.\n[3292.00] Do we have a do we have a left versus reality stinger, or is it a claim truth?\n[3296.64] Uh left.\n[3298.00] We don't have any stinger for this one.\n[3299.36] Oh we just have left versus things.\n[3301.20] Yeah.\n[3301.44] I can claim truth again, but really.\n[3307.20] You know, he's been making the rounds.\n[3308.72] He's been making a lot of progress.\n[3310.56] And yesterday, he met with some of the uh some people say Euro trash.\n[3315.52] I would never say that.\n[3316.24] Leaders in DC.\n[3317.84] And it all started off before we get to some of the claims from the left where they really want this administration to fail.\n[3324.32] And by that I mean they really want never-ending war.\n[3327.44] Um, it all kicked off with a warm welcome to Zelensky who put on a suit, sort of.\n[3333.60] I guess he got the message.\n[3347.76] Trump is on your message for the people of Ukraine.\n[3350.00] We're all right.\n[3351.76] We love them.\n[3353.04] We love them.\n[3360.48] Thank you very much, everybody goes.\n[3362.88] Couple of things there.\n[3363.92] First off, when he goes, this is the best I have, this suit, change it.\n[3368.24] That's why we think you're a disrespectful little prick.\n[3371.04] Stop by men's warehouse, get a two for one.\n[3375.12] And I look, look, this is the thing too.\n[3376.88] It's funny, right?\n[3377.52] Where people are talking about all cultures, hey, hey.\n[3380.40] It's a custom here.\n[3382.16] It just so happens to be a custom on the greatest country on earth.\n[3386.56] Put on a fucking suit.\n[3389.12] President Trump also, it's not a big deal.\n[3391.60] It's just respect our culture.\n[3393.44] You know.\n[3394.40] President Trump also, uh, by the way, was in rare form.\n[3397.12] Uh he had personalized greetings for each, I would never say Euro Trash leader.\n[3401.84] Everyone knows President Macron of France, who's been with me from the beginning, one of the first people I met as a foreign dignitary, and uh I like them from day one.\n[3414.88] And I like him even more now.\n[3416.56] That's pretty good.\n[3417.44] That's unusual.\n[3419.12] That's a pretty unusual thing.\n[3421.20] Prime Minister Maloney of Italy, who's a uh really great leader and an inspiration over there.\n[3427.84] She's uh she's served now, even though she's a very young person, she's served there for a long period of time relative to others.\n[3435.04] They don't they don't last very long.\n[3436.72] You've lasted a long time.\n[3438.40] You're gonna be there a long time.\n[3439.92] Chancellor Mertz of Germany, who is uh just put your Biden in this role person, right?\n[3446.48] And a very strong leader and very highly respected, and he's my friend, and it's another friend.\n[3453.28] Thank you very much.\n[3457.60] I want to I want to get a 10 like that.\n[3460.48] Where'd you get it?\n[3461.36] I get mine from a machine.\n[3464.24] I stand and go, whoa.\n[3466.32] Here's the thing.\n[3467.04] You may not like it, but the guy has something to offer in basic communications.\n[3473.20] Like well, but they got people to to laugh.\n[3475.12] You're there for a very serious subject.\n[3476.64] You compliment people, you got them laughing.\n[3478.96] He understands how to work a room.\n[3481.04] Well, one of the biggest lies that we were ever told, and they still try and sell is you know, we're being mocked, we're being uh we're we're the laughing stock of the international stage.\n[3489.12] Comment below.\n[3489.76] Does anyone actually believe that other leaders, the international community respected us more with Biden at the helm?\n[3497.04] Does anyone actually genuine comment?\n[3499.04] Right there, they're laughing and like, ah, this guy, you're in core you're incorrigible or whatever generic you're incorrigible.\n[3505.20] That's Finland.\n[3506.40] Wasn't Maloney the one that had to redirect him back to the meeting when they were doing the the D-Day memorial?\n[3512.72] I think so.\n[3513.52] She was the one that walked over and like grabbed him and was like, hey, by the way, be respectful.\n[3517.76] It's over here.\n[3518.64] Yeah.\n[3518.96] Yeah, exactly.\n[3519.60] This is where your country liberated our continent.\n[3522.32] Chocolate chip.\n[3524.08] By the way, so there were some all-time, all-time great photo ops, including President Trump showing off his hat collection.\n[3531.92] It's like, look, there's so many hats.\n[3534.88] That is hilarious.\n[3536.08] That was it's an episode of Gribs.\n[3538.64] That one right there goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3547.04] Still got uh it's a little blood there.\n[3540.48] Goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3546.96] Still got uh there's a little blood there.\n[3550.00] That's why it's red.\n[3551.04] I love that hat.\n[3552.48] I wish it's red on red, but it reminds me of the fact that I lived that God loves me more than you.\n[3567.76] Actually, all sport.\n[3569.12] I have to buy this on eBay.\n[3570.48] It's vintage.\n[3571.20] They stopped making it.\n[3572.32] Show the new Oval Office.\n[3573.52] This is where the magic happened.\n[3576.08] If you like it, it's all gold.\n[3577.92] I think it's a circle.\n[3579.04] Here's another uh picture.\n[3580.40] There's uh um what's in that the next one?\n[3583.28] Oh, yeah, this this picture of all the leaders gathered around the resolute desk.\n[3586.24] Look at that.\n[3587.12] They're all around there.\n[3587.84] I love how you like crammed him in.\n[3589.04] Like, you can all get closer.\n[3590.32] I need all this space.\n[3592.24] And uh the best.\n[3593.84] Here's a cap uh caption uh on X, because we put this out there.\n[3597.92] Um who posed can you bring it up?\n[3599.44] Who posted this?\n[3600.24] Huge huge wrote uh when you and your boys get caught being the weak men who create hard times.\n[3607.52] A runner up to it, uh Cole Hetty Lamar uh wrote Maloney.\n[3611.52] I was told there would be antipasto.\n[3616.72] I still don't fully know what that's it's like uh it's like appetizers in Italy.\n[3620.64] Yes, yes, okay.\n[3621.44] Well now I think she's the Italian, yeah.\n[3623.20] I just thought it was like something that didn't like the pasta.\n[3626.24] Okay, hey, and it's like cheese and wine and stuff like that.\n[3630.08] It's not enough to be anti this thing.\n[3631.92] You gotta get your own thing.\n[3633.20] Now, this picture may have been the best one right here.\n[3636.48] Look at that.\n[3636.96] It's the worst Avengers movie ever.\n[3641.28] But to be clear, they were also getting ready for the evening's festivities.\n[3645.12] I want it.\n[3649.44] We figure we throw it in.\n[3651.12] That's cohesion, huh?\n[3652.08] Yeah, no.\n[3653.60] So, and we're going to get to you're wrong about everything here, and the references are all available link in the description.\n[3659.60] This means that legacy media, seeing the man who's not supposed to be respected by the international community being unilaterally respected by the international community, seeing the man who was supposed to be a feckless, ineffective celebrity president being incredibly effective and accomplishing what no other leader's been able to do for years.\n[3675.68] Um, well, that made them spurg, and that means that they're completely up in arms, uh, accusing Donald Trump of abandoning Europe, doing Putin's bidding, you know, the same tired talking points that don't really apply, but they still try and apply him.\n[3688.64] The president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, decided to have a meeting with him, and then decided to invite him to the United States of America.\n[3697.60] He didn't have to do that.\n[3698.80] And then you're showing it, rolled out literally a red carpet for him.\n[3703.20] Putin clearly won.\n[3704.48] There's no world in which Donald Trump he doesn't like multilateral meetings because he likes to be able to bully people on their own.\n[3709.92] It's unusual.\n[3711.28] All the stuff you just saw doesn't even happen for our democratic allies.\n[3714.88] Got a flyover, a red carpet, fly.\n[3716.96] A lot of handshakes.\n[3718.32] A lot of great state TV coverage back called.\n[3720.80] How many times have you seen any of our democratic allies or NATO allies or allies in Asia treated like that?\n[3727.20] It doesn't even have to be.\n[3768.32] From former U.S.\n[3769.28] Secretary of State and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, here's what she has to say.\n[3775.28] This post she just put out a short time ago.\n[3777.68] She says, if Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.\n[3788.32] Does this let me ask you this?\n[3789.44] Does this actually work on anybody?\n[3791.04] Does that kind of assholery work on anybody?\n[3794.24] If if without Ukraine ceding any territory, tell me when that's ever happened in the history of mankind.\n[3799.92] An inferior nation militarily, and if not for Western Mike coming to help them, coming to terms in a war that they're losing without compromising anything.\n[3810.72] Oh, okay.\n[3811.60] You're trying to set up a standard that could never possibly be met.\n[3814.48] And as the as for the man saying they're gonna gaslight.\n[3818.24] Do you mean like gaslighting in the way that you said these leaders wouldn't meet with Donald Trump in the way that you said these leaders have no respect for President Trump?\n[3828.08] Because we're going to get to the exact words from these leaders while they were all meeting on one side of the table with Donald Trump.\n[3835.36] And let's keep that in mind, the word gaslighting.\n[3837.60] It's time for why everything you say.\n[3841.12] You're wrong about everything.\n[3846.48] Wrong.\n[3847.76] All right, let's start with the left.\n[3849.52] So what they say is that Friday's meeting with Putin was stupid, pointless, and uh something.\n[3854.96] Well, I think last Friday, that Alaska summit was one of the most disastrous summits that I can think of.\n[3860.64] Oh no.\n[3861.44] Uh did no good in terms of advancing America's interests or the interests of our allies or Ukraine.\n[3867.60] And we treated this horrible dictator who terrorizes Ukrainians every single night, as you just showed by killing them through these attacks on civilians.\n[3877.92] Uh, we treated him like he was some special uh friend of the United States.\n[3882.08] Okay, here's the reality.\n[3883.76] Okay.\n[3884.96] The NATO Secretary General Mark Root thanked President Trump.\n[3888.48] He didn't say it's completely pointless, rolled out a red carpet.\n[3891.52] He thanked President Trump for being the only person in years to finally break the deadlock.\n[3899.68] His words.\n[3907.36] Basically, uh with President Putin by starting the dialogue.\n[3910.96] And I think it was in February that you had to first phone call, and from there, we are now where we are today.\n[3917.28] Uh and that is uh, I think if we play this well, we could end it.\n[3921.52] And we have to end it.\n[3922.56] We have to stop the killing, we have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure.\n[3926.88] It is a terrible war.\n[3928.48] Um, so I'm I'm really excited.\n[3930.80] By the way, that man's not a conservative as you would know it to be in the United States.\n[3935.20] So you have the left in the United States.\n[3937.12] This is not it's accomplished nothing.\n[3938.48] He's sucking up to him, and you have that man, the man who would know, thanking President Trump for breaking the deadlock.\n[3947.12] Does that sound like we're less respected in the international?\n[3950.24] You know who didn't break the deadlock?\n[3952.16] Biden.\n[3952.96] Here's another one.\n[3953.84] The left.\n[3954.56] They claim that President Trump is still sucking up to Putin.\n[3959.20] What the Europeans are coming to give Trump some support, some ballast.\n[3963.92] By the way, join Rumble Premium because we have to go.\n[3965.68] We're running late.\n[3966.16] If not, you're gonna see Tim Poole.\n[3967.52] Cut it.\n[3968.08] I mean, I'm not sure.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

segments:\n[175.60] Welcome to the Rumble lineup live.\n[178.16] That's every weekday, 9 a.m.\n[180.48] Eastern through 7 p.m.\n[182.40] You don't need to change that dial.\n[183.76] Again, some of you are unfamiliar with Adal, kind of like manual windows.\n[187.36] We realized that after yesterday's sketch, but I think you get it in principle.\n[191.12] Welcome uh viewers coming in from Vince.\n[193.12] Uh of course, Bon Gino Army.\n[194.80] We're glad to have you here.\n[195.52] I know that Bonino has some assistance over there at the uh the old FBI, which reminds me.\n[200.40] Is James Comey okay?\n[202.40] I mean, I know he's a cross dresser, tell everybody, but I don't know if he's okay when you see his latest video.\n[207.68] We're gonna talk about that today.\n[208.64] He's a swifty.\n[212.48] He's a swifty, and s and old Swift inspired him to stand up against Trump.\n[217.04] And by stand up against Trump, I mean lie about Donald Trump and try and destroy his career, his credibility, and his livelihood.\n[222.48] So we're gonna talk about that.\n[223.44] It's no small thing.\n[224.56] Chris Pratt was on with Bill Maher.\n[226.72] Um I like Chris Pratt.\n[229.76] There was a uh a black leftist.\n[233.36] Picture her in your head.\n[234.48] Yep.\n[236.08] On Jubilee, I think it's what is it called?\n[238.16] Uh surrounded with 20 black conservatives.\n[240.40] That's fun, and it shows you everything wrong with black liberalism today.\n[243.04] And hey, is there headway to be made?\n[244.40] That's my question to you.\n[245.68] Remember the black sit sort of uh or sorry, Blex it never really materialized.\n[249.68] And we saw a huge shift in Latino votes, Hispanic votes, where younger Hispanic men are now actually voting uh as a majority Republican block.\n[257.84] Do you see that oscillation that's never really shifted with the black American vote ever going Republican?\n[263.12] And I don't mean in social media world, I mean in the real world.\n[265.28] Then of course, most important President Trump uh had his meeting with Zelensky, and um the left wants us to fail, and by that, I mean they want more war.\n[276.00] Either you want President Trump to succeed, and he is right now.\n[278.80] We're making a lot of headway here, which is good for Americans, or you want him to fail, in which case you want perpetual war.\n[285.36] By the way, the next commercial you're about to see, it's a new sponsor.\n[288.24] There's a lot of legal stuff that had to be included at the end.\n[291.04] So we'll see.\n[293.20] Yeah, I thought that was a kid's pool toys, the squeakers.\n[299.44] Sound I'll never forget.\n[306.72] Oh, hey, scene is Would you just would you just drive up it?\n[311.60] I'm a Claren.\n[313.52] That's like a 200,000 dollar car.\n[316.16] But that one out there.\n[317.20] Well.\n[320.56] It's a $50,000 Rolex, Billy.\n[322.88] Yeah, I guess it is, yeah.\n[324.40] New suit.\n[325.52] Yeah, it's great, isn't it?\n[327.84] Weren't you and I just having a conversation last week about your credit score being shot?\n[333.36] Was that last week?\n[334.56] Last week.\n[335.52] Oh.\n[338.24] No, it's not anybody's guess.\n[340.16] This is what it is, Billy.\n[342.24] 200,000 car, a $50,000 watch, and I remani's suit.\n[347.44] It's a mystery.\n[348.40] No, there's no mystery.\n[349.44] Your credit score is shot because of these completely unnecessary lavish purchases.\n[354.64] Oh.\n[355.52] Download the the kickoff app.\n[357.20] We talked about it.\n[357.92] They they help build your credit fast.\n[360.72] If you do that, I don't know if they'll help you with this, but give it a sharp house.\n[366.72] Killer suit, though, right?\n[369.52] Stop.\n[371.44] Billy, what's going on with your butt?\n[373.76] What's going on with your butt?\n[375.92] This is the way God made me.\n[377.36] This great, right?\n[382.96] Yeah.\n[383.92] How much was that?\n[385.84] Twelve thousand dollars.\n[393.12] Yeah, I guess.\n[394.72] Check it out.\n[400.24] Users for credit under 600 ruin average of 84 points in their first year with on-time payments.\n[403.44] With transparent affordable plan starting at just five dollars a month, no hidden fee, zero interest.\n[406.08] Kickoff helps you score big when it comes to credit.\n[407.44] It's simple.\n[407.76] You make on time payments, credit bureau, see good behavior, and your credit can grow fast.\n[409.92] Start building credit with kickoff for as well as one dollar.\n[411.92] That's eight percent normal price.\n[412.80] When you go to get kick off.com slash crowder today.\n[414.40] That's kick off with the get kick off.com slash crowd.\n[464.24] Yeah, I bet you'll get a call, Gerald.\n[467.60] Here's the thing I will say.\n[469.04] I will say this kickoff, and it's one of the few products I wearing a couple of things.\n[472.00] It's one of the few products that I don't use because I have stellar credit.\n[475.20] But uh it's really useful and it works, but there's so much stuff that needs to be included.\n[479.28] We were like, do we re uh okay, all right, but I do recommend it.\n[482.24] If you have if you have credit, that's bad.\n[484.00] Hey, it'll help you.\n[484.96] I just I don't know how long this I don't know how long the sponsorship's gonna last.\n[488.72] I need a shirt, guys.\n[489.60] I got so screwed up by all this, I kept my normal shirt on.\n[493.44] All right.\n[494.32] Uh and let me ask you this also another Donald Duck.\n[498.00] What?\n[498.48] Oh yeah.\n[507.28] Still one of the hardest uh times I've ever left in my life was you voicing Donald Trump Donald Duck being raped.\n[515.28] By the way, I don't say that to be profane, that's an actual thing that Doug do.\n[518.24] They do it to establish a pecking order.\n[520.72] Established!\n[523.60] Oh yeah, I got a lake in front of my house, dude.\n[525.52] It's sex city out there.\n[526.64] Dude, there are not people think it's orgy town.\n[529.76] What was Toolman?\n[530.56] You just went to color bars?\n[531.52] What was that?\n[532.00] Yeah, that was uh I thought it was kind of cool.\n[533.68] Wrong.\n[534.16] Alright.\n[534.64] Can you admonish yourself?\n[536.08] Hey, the good news is you can tune in to this level of quality every weekday, 11 a.m.\n[539.36] Eastern.\n[540.08] Captain Morgan, CEO, I know you're well.\n[541.92] Friday and Saturday, August 22nd and 23rd in Portland, Oregon, Helium Comedy Club.\n[546.96] Uh Josh Eerstein looking uh looking very 90s-ish with the hair product down the middle, but it'll make sense.\n[552.08] I don't know.\n[555.68] Too late, bad.\n[556.32] It's this weekend, by the way, in Portland.\n[557.84] Yeah.\n[558.32] Yeah.\n[558.64] Yeah.\n[559.04] I thought you were saying it was this week in like a Dawson's Creek reunion.\n[562.08] That's also happening in Portland.\n[563.36] We're gonna burn down a precinct that's gonna be great.\n[565.12] I liked Pacey.\n[566.00] I love how by the way, one of the assistants just brought in another shirt for Gerald.\n[570.08] Because he's so I thought she was gonna I thought she's gonna come in.\n[575.44] I thought she was gonna come in and be like, uh, kickoff has kicked us off.\n[578.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[580.16] All right.\n[580.88] Uh while Gerald was getting changed.\n[583.04] By the way, nice traps.\n[584.64] Yeah, good traps on that guy.\n[586.64] Hair all over him.\n[587.36] It's a stuff of children's nightmares.\n[588.96] So let me ask you this before I move on.\n[591.04] Uh hey, uh, you know all cultures are equal.\n[593.92] Mm-hmm.\n[594.72] Hell.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[599.28] Ping.\n[590.16] This before I move on.\n[591.52] Hey, uh, you know, all cultures are equal.\n[594.72] Oh.\n[595.36] Would you use this all natural soap?\n[600.16] Cow dung.\n[601.12] Can't be a luxury skincare.\n[602.88] Think again.\n[603.76] This is cowpeti's lavender and fun seed soap, a patented formula.\n[608.40] That is a pure genius.\n[610.08] Made from dry, beautified cow dung from indigenous cow blended with living.\n[614.72] Beautiful seeds and uh gotta be in indigenous cow dung.\n[619.44] DP hybrids and even helps heal skin issues like eczema wounds and mood.\n[624.88] It forms a legend.\n[626.56] Smells amazing from the start to finish, and outlaws so it says no paravents, no sulfates, no toxins, just clean seats gear.\n[637.20] Speak from nature.\n[638.32] Copetti wellness through mother go.\n[641.20] A couple of things that really are upsetting with that.\n[643.20] Number one is that someone will actually look at that and go, oh no, parabens.\n[646.56] That's good.\n[646.96] Yeah, you should be more concerned with the cow shit.\n[649.60] That's true.\n[650.24] I like that it's it says cowpathy, but she pronounces it cowpatty.\n[653.92] Yeah, exactly.\n[654.72] Yeah, I think that's very accurate.\n[656.16] She says outlast soap, but it sounds like outlaw soap.\n[660.24] This shower ain't big enough for the two of us.\n[663.28] And uh also when we say all cultures are equal, because here's the thing.\n[667.12] People will excuse this and go, oh, you know, yeah, cow dog.\n[669.36] First off, there's no there's no evidence that uh it will do anything other than make you smell like cowdung.\n[673.28] Second, you can't make those claims.\n[675.28] You understand that in the United States?\n[676.80] Like you can't, it will cure eczema, and it was starting the age.\n[680.32] Like she just says stuff.\n[681.76] And you can't say in the United States, you have to prove.\n[684.48] And I get it, we have a problem with the FDA, and there's a lot of red tape.\n[687.92] But for people out there who say all cultures are equal.\n[690.24] Do you also think that uh cultures are equal if only some cultures are allowed to make completely unsubstantiated medical claims?\n[696.88] What if someone out there with eczema thinks they're going to fix it with cow crap?\n[701.44] Is this why the trend of bleaching your skin is getting so big in India?\n[705.20] They're putting cow dung all over themselves, and they're like, oh, we gotta bleach that off.\n[708.40] That would make sense.\n[709.52] I like when they finally use soap, it has cow shit in it.\n[712.88] Yes, exactly.\n[714.96] So you can smell the way you want to.\n[716.88] That's right.\n[717.36] That's right.\n[717.84] Look!\n[719.28] Oh boy.\n[721.68] I just don't think that all cultures are equal.\n[723.76] And by that I mean some are bad and they'll remain bad, but it's a new trend.\n[727.76] This is a new trend, selling other cultures to the United States because it's novel, and it's not, or I should say India is not the only culture getting in on the action.\n[736.88] Hey, do you think that bird can't be a healthy hecka product?\n[741.92] Think again.\n[743.60] This is caca de pajaro.\n[745.76] It's made with the finest avocados, cilantro, and bird.\n[750.80] It's a sustainably sourced two in one shampoo and conditioner that will leave your hair feeling silky and smooth.\n[760.16] You look like a million pesos.\n[765.04] That's good luck.\n[766.40] Although he's basically saying you'll look like four dollar.\n[770.24] It's like it's like a thousand bucks.\n[772.64] It sounds impressive.\n[773.68] I don't think so.\n[774.48] Yeah, it is.\n[777.28] I'm gonna guess.\n[777.92] I'm gonna guess 1100.\n[779.04] Hey, great.\n[779.84] What is it?\n[780.40] All right.\n[783.84] 10 grand.\n[784.40] Because I'm American, and this place is better.\n[786.40] Yes, what's the number?\n[787.92] 53,189.\n[790.00] Whoa!\n[791.04] Coming up.\n[791.68] That's the new pay soon.\n[792.88] Hey, bro, you look like 53,489 dollars.\n[797.28] 93 cents.\n[798.16] Don't forget that, bro.\n[799.12] And bro, I round it up.\n[801.28] So get kick off.\n[804.32] Yeah.\n[807.68] Uh I'll tell you who needs to get kicked off the globe.\n[810.80] James Comey.\n[811.68] Well, that's impossible.\n[813.44] And I I this is it's it's funny, it's cringe inducing, and I warn you, this is like over a minute, and it's been cut down from six minutes.\n[822.24] But I remember I've told you this in the past where the left, they just they overuse the term gaslighting.\n[827.04] And the reason they use that is because that's what they do.\n[829.04] So James Comey, first off, he's a Swifty.\n[832.16] Okay.\n[832.48] And he talks about how being a Swifty uh allowed him to stand up to bullies like Donald Trump and gave him the strength.\n[838.64] Here's the thing.\n[839.44] We now know beyond any shadow of a doubt that there was spying on the Trump campaign, right?\n[844.16] That the Russia collusion hoax is just that a hoax.\n[846.96] It was fabricated and it was leaked to the media.\n[848.96] We we we know all of these things.\n[851.44] And he complains and talks about how Donald Trump was the only man who would come after me, and Donald Trump was the only man who I felt the need to record convert because I didn't trust.\n[859.76] What in reality he was part of a fabricated campaign to destroy a man's reputation, his ability to make a living, his family, his legacy.\n[871.12] And I would imagine that President Trump was probably aggressive and aggravated.\n[875.12] Hey, if you were in your workplace and there was an employee who was falsifying emails, pictures to try and get you fired, and to try sending them to your wife.\n[886.40] You were cheating on her, and you knew that it wasn't true, but people were believing it.\n[890.08] Everyone was.\n[890.80] Do you think he'd maybe be mad?\n[892.48] And do you think he'd maybe be a little aggressive with that guy?\n[895.20] And then would that man, James Comey, and this example in this example, would he be entitled to feign outrage and claim victim status?\n[904.24] That's what James Comey has done.\n[906.48] And that's why I believe that James Comey should face serious charges and jail time for his crimes.\n[912.32] But that's not what we're discussing today.\n[913.76] More important is that he's a Swifty, and he's been a fan of her since he was a fully grown man and she was 14.\n[919.60] Donald Trump is still president and still humiliating America on a national stage standing next to Vladimir Putin.\n[926.00] It's like a dream, a bad dream you can't wake up from.\n[929.76] But I don't want to talk about that bad dream this week.\n[931.92] I want to talk about a truly inspirational public figure named Taylor Swift.\n[935.52] This is a hostage.\n[936.56] Taylor Swift, and I go way back.\n[938.88] I went to my first concert of hers 15 years ago.\n[941.76] It was creepy then.\n[942.64] I've been to a second, and I have helped financially support the attendance of a lot of family members at others.\n[949.12] I'm in a family's Swifty group chat.\n[951.76] That's so sad.\n[952.64] I know all her music, and I listened to it in my headphones when I cut the grass.\n[958.88] Although honestly, for me, it's a tie between all too well, 10-minute version and exile, featuring Bonnie Vare.\n[965.92] At every stage of her career, she's shown a certain way of being that resonated with my kids.\n[971.44] Patya Lynn to me as a parent.\n[974.24] And she's still doing that as a grown-up.\n[977.92] Like a lot of you, I struggle with how to stand up to bullies without letting their meanness infect me and change me.\n[990.08] There are far more decent, honest, kind people in America than there are mean jerks.\n[996.56] And don't get me wrong.\n[997.76] We have our jerks, millions of them.\n[999.68] You can have noticed.\n[1000.80] Of course, we need to stand up to jerks and defend what matters.\n[1004.80] But I think we have to try to do that when you're like them.\n[1009.28] Which is what makes me think about Taylor Swift.\n[1012.56] She's made clear that she sees Donald Trump for what he is.\n[1015.92] And last year she urged Americans not to make the serious mistake of electing him.\n[1021.60] Of course, we're now living with the consequences of that mistake, but we know you were involved in a home.\n[1033.44] What's she doing?\n[1035.20] Living her best life.\n[1037.04] Producing great music and as she urged all of us to do during the podcast.\n[1042.00] Why?\n[1042.64] Not giving the jerks power over her mind.\n[1045.36] At my second Taylor Swift concert in Hartford tonight.\n[1050.96] She sang a song about it.\n[1052.80] Why does this exist?\n[1056.40] Why you gotta be so mean?\n[1057.76] And she spoke directly to the nasty people.\n[1060.08] Thank you, Taylor Swift.\n[1062.00] Keep the faith.\n[1063.28] I'm sure she'll take your advice to heart.\n[1066.40] First off, the lack of this reminds me of the you know of office space, Michael Bolton.\n[1071.28] Yeah.\n[1072.24] I celebrate his entire catalog.\n[1074.16] Like it's a joke, and he doesn't realize that it's a joke.\n[1076.16] Also, what you just saw is the problem of feminism personified.\n[1080.56] What do I mean?\n[1081.44] I mean valuing the wrong things.\n[1083.28] I mean valuing nice.\n[1084.48] Hey, Hitler was nice to kids.\n[1085.76] Osama bin Laden was nice to kids.\n[1087.60] You have plenty of horrible people who are nice.\n[1089.36] It's their actions that define them.\n[1091.84] Comey believes he's nice.\n[1093.28] Comey is underhanded, dishonest, and a man of no integrity.\n[1097.20] Who would you rather deal with?\n[1098.16] Someone who's rough around the edges, someone who sends out mean tweets, someone who tells you things that you don't like to hear, but you can count on to be the same person, or somebody who can't be relied upon to pick up your children from school, even if he gives you his word, but he does it with a smile.\n[1114.88] Feminism says nice matters.\n[1117.20] Patriarchy masculinity says that integrity, reliability, dependability, and discipline matters.\n[1125.12] If I have to pick, and Donald Trump is a very flawed man.\n[1127.52] If I have to pick a Donald Trump, or by the way, anyone like uh George Washington or a Jefferson or a Teddy Roosevelt over a Comey or Barack Obama type, I'm going with the strong man who may be a little tougher to deal with every single time.\n[1144.16] Yeah, you know who wasn't nice?\n[1145.36] Winston Churchill.\n[1146.48] That's why he was voted out only a couple years after he helped fight off the axis of evil.\n[1150.00] You know why?\n[1150.40] Because he wasn't nice enough to want socialized health care.\n[1153.92] So it's not a small thing.\n[1155.12] That is feminism personified.\n[1156.96] That is a weak, weak man, and weak men lie, and weak men are untrustworthy.\n[1163.12] And you know who loves weak men?\n[1165.20] Taylor Swift.\n[1166.48] It's clear as day.\n[1167.44] This isn't anything new, by the way.\n[1169.52] So I I don't want to be too harsh on him.\n[1171.44] Plenty of intelligence officials have taken uh cues and great influence from the pop stars of their time.\n[1177.12] Uh who can forget J.\n[1178.00] Edgar Hoover professing his undying love for share.\n[1181.04] Do you believe and of course there was the poorly received Joseph.\n[1180.24] Share.\n[1187.60] And of course, there was the poorly received Joseph McCarthy Ziggy Stardust era.\n[1192.56] This is God.\n[1197.92] And some were a swing and a miss.\n[1200.00] Who can forget the big flop with uh, of course, the head over there, Christopher.\n[1204.88] Uh baby, I was born this Ray.\n[1209.44] Rama Rama.\n[1211.36] The point is gay.\n[1214.32] All right.\n[1216.24] Uh.\n[1217.28] Hey, you know what?\n[1218.48] Uh, you could be a pastor somewhere with that effeminate kind of male thing going on.\n[1224.16] That's I I hate seeing that.\n[1226.16] Listen, it doesn't mean you have to, you know, be some guy that goes out and crushes beers on your skull or something like that.\n[1231.36] No, of course not.\n[1232.40] That's what I'm saying.\n[1233.84] Complaining about bullying when you're the head of the FBI at one point.\n[1237.12] Yeah.\n[1237.52] For four years, you were the head of the FBI and you're complaining about bullying?\n[1240.96] Here's the thing, too.\n[1241.60] That's that's a weird thing.\n[1243.04] It's really easy for them to act nice.\n[1244.48] Right, think about it.\n[1245.12] Everyone thought that Barack Obama was per hey, he's the kind of guy you want to have a beer with.\n[1248.40] By the way, best way to follow me is download the Rumble app, follow me there.\n[1251.28] You'll get this show where live weekdays at 11 a.m.\n[1253.36] Eastern.\n[1253.76] Don't be tied to an algorithm on social media.\n[1256.72] Think about this.\n[1257.36] He accuses Donald Trump of bullying.\n[1259.12] Donald Trump was a, no, wealthy?\n[1261.44] Sure.\n[1261.92] But we all know that wealth doesn't necessarily get you into office, right?\n[1265.04] As seen by spending more money than ever, the uh Kamala Harris campaign.\n[1270.00] Grey Ray, Christopher Ray, Barack Obama, and of course you can sort of add in Hillary Clinton.\n[1275.44] They all took part in a concerted campaign to spy on, destroy the reputation of and leak false information against one man who they didn't like.\n[1286.64] Can you think of any more clear example of bullying than that?\n[1290.24] Right.\n[1290.72] But because Donald Trump said, go screw yourself or whatever.\n[1294.16] We're supposed to believe he's the bully.\n[1295.76] The most powerful people on earth tried to secure their positions of power by as a gang bullying an individual they didn't like who, by the way, was supported by the American public.\n[1308.16] And just to be clear, and I know Ray, the timeline, he's he's gone after that.\n[1312.56] But after Donald Trump did win, they still trumped up a fabricated campaign to delegitimize him, knowing that it was false.\n[1323.28] They were bullying you.\n[1325.04] These people in position when people say it's a big club and you're not in it, they're talking about the Rays, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bidens.\n[1332.00] You understand that they're not talking about the Trumps.\n[1334.00] They're not talking about a real estate agent from New York.\n[1336.48] I can't think of a worse bully and a bully more corrosive to the American fabric.\n[1341.36] You want to know why you don't trust your institutions?\n[1343.36] The left wants to blame you when they want to create a department of misinformation.\n[1346.24] It's Christopher Ray.\n[1348.56] It's Comey.\n[1350.48] That's why you don't trust your institutions.\n[1352.56] And you shouldn't.\n[1354.32] Someone who probably understands where you're coming from.\n[1356.32] Chris Pratt was on Bill Mars uh show.\n[1359.52] Um not the HBO one that people watch, but the one that is entirely uh guest dependent.\n[1365.44] And it's true.\n[1367.92] I will say this.\n[1368.56] You can criticize Chris Pratt there because we all know that he's a uh a a Christian, and I would tend to guess that he leans more conservative, moderate, though he hasn't been super clear about that, but he's very clear about his faith.\n[1379.68] You could uh criticize him for being a fence sitter if you watch the clips, I think in full context, maybe maybe not.\n[1387.04] You could criticize him for being a little milk toast, maybe, but that's not why the left criticizes criticizes him on uh on his appearance on Bill Maher.\n[1396.32] They watched what you're about to watch, and people on the left believe that Chris Pratt is literally Hitler.\n[1402.16] Let's see.\n[1403.04] And in politics, you you inherit enemies.\n[1405.04] And when you jump on in in on, you know, the bandwagon with who is you know the most divisive president ever.\n[1413.12] It makes sense that you're going to be uh made to look terrible.\n[1420.08] And so I don't know what to believe.\n[1421.68] Because I it's not like I sit with Bobby and I go, so hey, let's talk about this.\n[1424.96] Let's talk about it.\n[1425.52] It's like we're just playing cards or playing mafia or having fun or having dinner.\n[1428.48] I'm not gonna pick his brain to find out exactly which of those things are true.\n[1431.04] I just kind of assume that none of them are.\n[1433.12] And for the most part, I wish him well, man.\n[1435.44] I hope that's kind of things that he uh oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way, like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food.\n[1445.04] I think that's a great thing.\n[1446.48] And so just if you just do that, that's amazing.\n[1449.60] I I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be have an allergic reaction to.\n[1457.36] To be like, oh, well, if they do it, I don't want it to happen.\n[1460.32] Um I'll feed my I'll put Clorox in my children's cereal myself.\n[1465.68] Come on, have some be reasonable here.\n[1467.52] There's certain things that would be a good thing to have.\n[1469.04] Uh I want them all to be successful.\n[1471.52] So you may say, like, ah, you know, hey, you could take that a little bit further, Mr.\n[1475.44] Pratt.\n[1476.00] No, I'm not saying that because that's not his job.\n[1478.08] He's an actor.\n[1478.88] Yeah.\n[1480.00] But the left is saying that was that was far enough.\n[1483.36] Did you hear what he said?\n[1484.40] That brings us to Reddit Retards.\n[1491.92] Bang him.\n[1493.28] And just in case you say I'm taking it out of contact.\n[1495.12] Go watch the entire interview.\n[1496.24] It's very similar to that in in tone.\n[1498.32] I would like it if Bill Marr let his guests speak a little more, but that's neither here nor there.\n[1501.60] Well, he was high, so we didn't know.\n[1503.28] So on Reddit, the responses to what you just saw.\n[1505.84] Best animator 182.\n[1508.08] The hatred is extremely reasonable, and Chris Rat.\n[1512.00] I like how they changed the name there.\n[1513.68] Is an idiot.\n[1514.72] There is nothing admirable about policies rooted in eugenics.\n[1520.24] Mentally retarded.\n[1522.00] Well, also no animations there.\n[1524.00] Uh kind of a fake name.\n[1525.84] Yeah.\n[1526.64] Yeah.\n[1526.96] Also, um, I think you might want to do a little bit, uh, a little bit of a uh a background check on eugenics.\n[1533.04] And particularly the history in the uh the 19th and 20th century.\n[1537.28] Not gonna like how it turns up, buttercup Kendall underscore with underscore one underscore L.\n[1543.68] Chris Pratt wants to kill all autistic people.\n[1547.44] Maybe she's retarded.\n[1548.80] No, actually, that was Margaret Sanger.\n[1550.32] Look into Planned Parenthood.\n[1551.52] Wow.\n[1551.84] She gotta change her name to two L's.\n[1553.28] Yeah, he wants to take out red dye from food.\n[1556.08] Or actually, I let me let me really represent Chris Pratt's position uh as accurately as I can.\n[1561.44] He doesn't want to be so mired in hatred that he blindly has to be angry about RFK Jr.\n[1567.52] doing something like removing a notable, a known toxin from children's cereal.\n[1574.16] Contrast that with Margaret Sanger, um, Planned Parenthood specifically wanted to eliminate any and all babies with birth defects.\n[1581.84] And by the way, also most black babies.\n[1584.00] Feisty underscore B 9175.\n[1587.44] What an idiot.\n[1588.72] Not surprising though.\n[1590.16] He is hyper religious and spouts Christian.\n[1593.28] That's corrected from the person who calls him an idiot.\n[1596.48] Bible verses publicly all the time.\n[1598.96] I put him up there, were I think with the other nut job has been actors like Dean Kane, Kevin Sorbo, and Jenny McCarthy.\n[1608.88] McCarthy.\n[1612.96] I've spent enough I've spent quite a bit of time with Dean Kane and Kevin Sorbo has been on the show.\n[1616.56] Uh I I know for certain that uh Dean Kane knows how to spell with.\n[1621.68] I mean, we can try.\n[1622.96] They were literally shaking typing on the comics at is it AI or Al.\n[1628.16] Some of us are old enough to remember the MAGA GOP hissy fits when Michelle Obama promoted healthier eating habits as first lady.\n[1635.28] Wonder what this Pratt had to say about that.\n[1638.32] I hate being retarded.\n[1639.84] Here's the thing.\n[1640.88] No one has a problem with somebody telling you to be healthier.\n[1644.80] The Michelle Obama campaign, right?\n[1647.76] The healthier school lunches were a complete failure again because it was predicated on the uh the idea that government could fix everything.\n[1653.12] The lunches were expensive, they were gross.\n[1655.20] Kids refused to eat them, so they just ended up trading them for other goodies and treats.\n[1659.36] It increased it waste.\n[1660.88] Kids were still hungry because they wouldn't eat the lunches.\n[1663.20] And by the way, it's at the same time as Barack Obama eliminated the presidential fitness test.\n[1667.28] So if you're going to say, hey, everyone, let's move more, let's be healthier.\n[1671.84] Great.\n[1672.40] Don't combine that with all body types are just as beautiful and healthy.\n[1676.08] And don't eliminate the presidential fitness test.\n[1678.08] It was about making people feel good no matter what they did, as opposed to being based on results.\n[1682.80] Also, the issue there is that she wasn't president and we're tired of the first lady's stupid pet projects.\n[1690.40] She's gonna stay busy.\n[1691.76] Yeah.\n[1692.88] The healthy school lunch program, just to be clear, it was about as successful and gross as Mexico's school lunch program.\n[1703.60] Muy delicioso.\n[1707.52] This has been Reddit Retards.\n[1716.64] Gerald, plug the merch store before we get to the blacks.\n[1719.20] Go to Crattershop.com right now to get this shirt, not the one that I was wearing a minute ago.\n[1723.36] There's only two genders or pro gun or pro cow poop.\n[1727.28] I don't think we have a pro cow poop.\n[1728.56] No, I'm very anti.\n[1729.68] Probably find one as a general rule.\n[1731.60] I don't know.\n[1731.92] We'll see.\n[1732.32] Pro dung.\n[1732.96] Yeah.\n[1733.36] Crowder shop.com.\n[1734.32] Find something cool.\n[1734.96] Good word, by the way.\n[1736.40] We had one employee here who literally smelled like cow poop.\n[1739.12] Really?\n[1739.60] Yeah, it was short-lived.\n[1740.56] Oh, we don't know.\n[1741.36] You know, you remember.\n[1743.36] So I don't want to get into too much detail.\n[1748.00] Uh it was I will tell you this.\n[1750.48] Look, look, for as much as people like love to bitch about the boss, we had to have meetings on how to approach uh a person who smelled so bad that other employees were complaining without hurting their feelings or sort of stepping on a legal liability landmine.\n[1766.00] Do you have any idea how difficult that is?\n[1767.92] When you have a you have employees threatening to quit because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.04] Yes.\n[1770.24] Because they have to sit in proximity to someone who smells so bad that it affects their work.\n[1776.08] I know it's already over, but can I suggest uh an idea?\n[1779.12] Yes.\n[1779.52] How about uh you start a prank war.\n[1781.04] Uh-huh.\n[1781.52] Tell them what's a prank war, and then they're the only one that gets pranked.\n[1784.32] And it's like they walk through a door and you know, soap falls on it.\n[1788.08] Yes.\n[1788.32] So they hit a tripwire as they walk by their desk, and then Fabrizio just goes.\n[1794.24] Yes, exactly.\n[1795.20] They behind a door and it's just a tool chest.\n[1797.20] Like, what was that?\n[1798.00] It was the sound of 5,000 bars of ivory coming down to stairs.\n[1802.96] I prayed to you.\n[1803.92] I covered your seat in dryer sheets.\n[1806.16] Yeah.\n[1807.36] It was uncomfortable.\n[1808.72] Speaking of uncomfortable.\n[1810.64] Guys, I did take a shower.\n[1812.88] So uh let me ask you this.\n[1814.64] Can you identify, and I'm not talking about talking heads.\n[1817.12] I'm not talking about people who are uh just in the space where they they revolve around political commentary.\n[1821.76] Can you identify a major black celebrity who's conservative?\n[1826.88] I heard Denzel Washington.\n[1828.72] Uh no, he's he's he's voted Democrat, he's a Christian, and he encourages accountability, but doesn't fully connect the dots.\n[1834.48] And by the way, I from everything that I've seen and heard like Denzel Washington, we probably would disagree on some issues politically.\n[1841.04] Uh another question for you do you think there's ever going to be a point where the scales tip?\n[1846.88] Because we saw it with Hispanic votes.\n[1848.48] We saw it with Gen Z.\n[1849.68] We've never seen it to a significant degree with black votes in America.\n[1852.64] And we have more black representatives or commentators uh than ever.\n[1857.52] You know, back when we were growing up, you pretty much had Thomas Sowell and kind of Larry Elder.\n[1861.84] Um Alan Keyes, Herman King Alfonso Rachel was an early and OG.\n[1865.76] I'd recommend go checking him out on YouTube.\n[1867.44] He was one of the first people there.\n[1868.72] But now you have a ton of people.\n[1870.16] The Blexit never really materialized.\n[1872.80] Do you think that it'll ever happen?\n[1875.36] Comment.\n[1877.68] And uh I I also understand why it's so um it's so tipped uh towards one side uh as far as politically with black people, because if you look or listen to anything in media, um, you will only see black celebrities assuming that you must be.\n[1900.16] You must be, unless you're a traitor, uh, liberal if you're black.\n[1905.92] We are voting for the right to choose what happens to our own bodies.\n[1912.64] We are damn black bitch.\n[1914.96] I choose you ourselves from this precipice of danger.\n[1920.40] Well, I misspelled respect.\n[1922.64] And a lot of these cake corrected me in a hashtag.\n[1929.36] Now I want y'all to help me correct President Trump to teach him what it means.\n[1934.48] Ladies and gentlemen, please.\n[1937.04] Nice haircut.\n[1937.92] Big loud Texas, welcome to the next president of the United States.\n[1945.28] Come on.\n[1946.80] You think that this guy has done stuff for black people.\n[1951.84] All I gotta say is crack is whack.\n[1955.84] I'm not trying to be funny.\n[1957.52] Well, mission accomplished.\n[1958.88] Nothing has never done enough for black folks.\n[1961.60] Thank you for all that.\n[1962.32] It's a double negative.\n[1963.12] That means he's done something.\n[1964.08] I know you guys are excited to see her.\n[1965.60] I didn't know you guys would be excited to see me too.\n[1967.60] But uh Yeah.\n[1969.68] I gotta go disappear to what I call training camp for a few weeks, come back with a bolts butt and ten new pounds of muscle.\n[1975.20] Now this brings us to uh the uh I keep wanting to say outnumbered, the surrounded, which for those of you who are unfamiliar, it's basically change my mind with a vote timer.\n[1986.88] Um it is, it really is.\n[1989.60] And this is one black radical.\n[1992.08] This is uh an actress, Amanda Seals, uh, versus 20 black um conservatives.\n[1997.44] Now, here's the thing.\n[1998.08] I w uh we're going to get into some of the claims versus the reality.\n[2002.48] Um, but this is important to to note, it's a technique that's used a lot.\n[2007.28] And I've encountered it in Change My Mind quite a bit.\n[2009.60] And right, Change My Mind was just sit down, establish uh the premise, which they refer to as a prompt, and anyone can sit down and you know, change your mind.\n[2018.88] Okay.\n[2019.76] You've seen people do this where what they do is the in betweens.\n[2023.04] If they know their argument doesn't really hold any water, they try and taint it with things like, you know, oh, you're unreasonable, or ugh, I can't believe these people must be paid actors.\n[2033.20] Or ugh, they try if their argument doesn't hold water, they try and tip those scales on a it's performance art.\n[2040.16] So as bad as you thought this was going to be with Amanda Seals, it's much worse.\n[2045.36] I'm not sure where your education came from, but they lied to you.\n[2048.80] I hope some of y'all are acting.\n[2050.40] I really do.\n[2051.68] I knew I was gonna be surrounded by ignorance, but damn, let's go.\n[2054.96] And my points are just as valid as yours, even though you got a pocket square and a church of Christ uh pin on your chest.\n[2061.28] Whatever.\n[2061.92] It's a cross, same difference.\n[2063.12] You got an American flag and you think you know something because you a cop.\n[2065.60] And ultimately not a cop, this much of it.\n[2067.60] It's a it's a cab all day over here.\n[2069.36] So let me make that clear.\n[2071.76] But you're literally speaking this.\n[2073.28] And you're not going to do that with me either.\n[2074.56] So you're stating your point.\n[2076.08] Y'all just want to be seen.\n[2077.44] I don't need to be seen.\n[2078.40] You're coming.\n[2078.96] That's why you're dressed like a poison dart frog.\n[2082.08] Just like she fell in the four buckets of the chimney or not.\n[2084.48] I have not had, you know, first of all, you're a light skin woman.\n[2087.84] So are you?\n[2088.48] Yes, and you're doing great cell.\n[2090.96] Yes, and so colorism really does serve us.\n[2094.00] This is scary.\n[2095.04] You need to think about me as your mama.\n[2096.88] Do not talk to me in that fashion.\n[2098.48] So let's check that now.\n[2100.16] See, and this is what happens too.\n[2101.68] Sometimes I refer to tone policing, but she's telling some, you need to do this.\n[2106.72] Now, I don't mean it's it's very reasonable to require someone if you are offering them respect to be respectful.\n[2112.48] Like, hey, I didn't, and I've done this.\n[2114.00] Hey, you know, I let you finish.\n[2115.36] Yeah.\n[2115.68] Uh you gotta let me finish.\n[2117.76] Or occasionally I'll go, you know what?\n[2119.76] I'm going to finish uh my thought as though you're an adult capable of giving the same respect I've given you.\n[2125.92] But that's not what she's doing.\n[2126.80] She's like, you need to think of me like yo mama.\n[2129.76] How entitled can you be?\n[2131.84] You don't get to tell someone what to think or how they should view you.\n[2135.20] Here's how someone's going to view you, usually.\n[2137.60] It's usually going to be based on your actions.\n[2141.20] And in this case, your words, your stupid, stupid words.\n[2145.84] So seals, just to give you an idea, was at the center of quite a few uh controversies herself.\n[2151.28] For example, defending Jesse Smollett, quote, even if it was a hoax.\n[2155.68] What?\n[2156.24] Yeah, this is someone who just if black people can do no wrong.\n[2159.92] Even if it was a hoax and cost taxpayer dollars in the and the city, and even if it did stir racial division and hatred, you know, another hoax too, like Michael Brown, hands up, don't shoot.\n[2169.68] Jesse Smallett's funny.\n[2171.04] Black lives matter, the terrorism, the billions of dollars in damage.\n[2174.00] That was also a hoax.\n[2176.00] So she was also kicked out of a black Emmy party.\n[2178.40] She got into a feud with a black sorority, and she claimed that she was autistic without ever actually being diagnosed, which is funny, but hey, it's not just black white.\n[2186.64] That's feminism to the letter.\n[2188.80] Just claim victim status, and you assume you win the argument, but that doesn't fly here.\n[2193.84] It's time for claim truth.\n[2199.44] Can we go back claiming autism as a tool in an argument?\n[2204.24] That's real retarded, sir.\n[2205.60] Sure.\n[2206.00] Yeah, it's a it's a it's a thing that a lot of people do.\n[2208.64] Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n[2209.92] The only person who never will is Al Sharpton who spells respect with two K's.\n[2215.36] Respect.\n[2216.32] I misspell respect.\n[2217.60] It's crazy.\n[2218.16] That was actually very revealing.\n[2219.20] Because to me, I just thought it's the way he speaks.\n[2220.88] No, in his mind, he's going, R E S P E KK, that is what it means to me.\n[2226.32] Yeah, there's a whole song.\n[2228.32] I don't know.\n[2229.28] I don't think I would ever get to the point in an argument where I'm like, but I'm retarded.\n[2233.04] Yeah.\n[2233.76] Well, you don't need to say it.\n[2234.72] I don't think you said in an argument, I think she was just claiming it.\n[2236.80] She's claiming it.\n[2237.52] Yeah, but why?\n[2238.24] Anyway.\n[2238.80] Because it's a status symbol to say.\n[2240.32] It's a victim.\n[2241.28] It is.\n[2241.60] It's like I'm a marginalized group.\n[2244.64] I'm I'm not only am I black, but I'm also a woman.\n[2247.20] And not only that, but I'm on the lowest end possible of being retarded.\n[2250.96] Yeah.\n[2251.20] No, no, no.\n[2251.68] I don't know.\n[2252.08] I I get it, but then you try to put yourself out there as somebody who can articulate the points of why reparations are a thing.\n[2258.00] Like you've basically just under, oh, so I don't need to listen to you.\n[2261.12] No, no, no.\n[2261.76] I understand you're being logical.\n[2262.96] That's your problem.\n[2263.84] Is if you take away victim status.\n[2265.76] Right.\n[2266.16] If you completely remove it.\n[2267.04] Okay.\n[2267.28] In other words, if you don't go, wait, black, white, okay, well, hold on a second, um, white woman, black guy, what uh trans, okay, disabled.\n[2274.00] Right.\n[2274.32] If you take all of that away, you actually have to um rest on the the validity of your arguments.\n[2282.16] Your actual thoughts.\n[2283.20] Yeah.\n[2283.52] Your opinions.\n[2284.16] So if you take all of the identity politics away, it just comes down to actions, performance, arguments, claims.\n[2293.28] We can't have that, and we certainly don't have that in the public school system.\n[2296.32] So the first claim uh that's made systemic ra and this has been addressed in changed my mind well over half a decade ago.\n[2306.08] Actually, systemic racism, by the way, challenge is still out there of one example today in the 21st century.\n[2311.04] Systemic racism is real, says the self-diagnosed retard.\n[2314.96] Ultimately, systemic racism exists in our institutions on a government level in our institutions, whether it's prisons or schools, and it is undeniable because they are actively trying to reinstate it right now.\n[2329.44] Okay.\n[2330.08] So the truth, it's hard to deal with claims that make no sense.\n[2334.72] I don't know what you mean by trying to reinstate it.\n[2336.40] And I watched the whole thing, and it still doesn't make sense.\n[2338.48] Uh blacks are completely proportionally represented in Congress, right?\n[2341.52] In government, okay, about 14%.\n[2343.68] And uh, as far as prison, now again, her premise, but again, she's she's on the spectrum according to her, is just black people are being put there because they're black.\n[2351.52] Black people in this country, despite making up twelve to thirteen percent of the population commit over half of all the violent crimes.\n[2358.08] And then if you look at wait systemic discrimination, okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students.\n[2360.00] Okay, well, we know that Asians and white people have been discriminated against in colleges, for example.\n[2363.44] They have to have higher GPAs, better SAT scores, and still can't get in.\n[2368.08] Whereas black students who are woefully underqualified in some cases, they do.\n[2373.92] They do get in.\n[2374.72] DEI exists.\n[2377.20] And here's the thing, too.\n[2378.08] When she goes on to talk about reparations, they act as though those things have never taken place.\n[2383.12] DEI is reparational.\n[2384.40] Affirmative action is reparations.\n[2385.76] Model Cities program is reparations.\n[2387.92] EBT, SNAP, the baby mama that was created by these are reparations.\n[2391.68] Section 8 housing, more money into public school.\n[2394.32] These are reparations that have been paid to the tune of trillions of dollars and have made nothing better.\n[2400.64] Now she may say those aren't the reparations we want, but those are the reparations that exist because it's what their party and what their community, the black community, have demanded.\n[2408.96] They petitioned, they got these reparations, and it didn't work.\n[2415.04] The answer, if you ask them, so when is it enough is always more.\n[2419.60] Here's the next claim that she makes.\n[2423.12] And this is a tough one.\n[2424.24] I don't even know.\n[2424.88] It's like grabbing a bar of soap.\n[2426.64] Uh soap.\n[2428.08] Which kind of soap, yeah.\n[2429.52] Done so.\n[2430.56] Harriet Tubman was uh actually aided by white supremacy something.\n[2436.40] I refuse to embrace a victim mentality because that's not what our grandparents and Harriet Tugman and those people fall for.\n[2442.96] They fought for whatever.\n[2444.00] Do not bring that Harriet Tubman's name in vain, baby.\n[2447.52] Please name in vain.\n[2451.20] Harriet Tubman was literally, literally saving her family and others from slavery.\n[2460.00] Yeah.\n[2460.80] You know who helped her white people.\n[2462.64] You know who helped her.\n[2463.68] They were on the underground railroad.\n[2465.04] No, no, no, no, you know, helped her.\n[2466.96] Come on, even though you know who helped her?\n[2469.44] Guy.\n[2470.16] And there are people who benefit from white supremacy.\n[2473.36] What?\n[2474.40] That guy had answers.\n[2475.60] Yeah, he did.\n[2476.64] He did.\n[2477.52] Uh, okay, so the truth to this one.\n[2481.52] I uh uh okay.\n[2483.76] So here's my understanding of her uh of her uh again, self-diagnosed uh autistic argument is that um white people helped Harriet Tubman, but they could only help her because they were beneficiaries of white supremacy, therefore white supremacy helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2499.60] Okay, so you don't want allies.\n[2502.48] Get it done with 12% of the population.\n[2505.44] I would help, but I benefit from white supremacy.\n[2508.40] Everyone in this room, by the way, you're precluded from helping because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2512.40] Tell that to the Quaker Church who helped Harriet Tubman.\n[2515.20] Yeah.\n[2515.76] Tell it to Massachusetts Governor uh John Andrew.\n[2518.96] Tell it to the multiple whites who helped with the underground railroad specifically, just to be clear.\n[2524.56] No, no, no, you guys all have to stop because you've benefited from white supremacy.\n[2528.56] Oh, so the slaves should do it on their own.\n[2531.04] This is a way of removing any and all credit for the good deeds that white people have committed.\n[2538.00] In the name of I know this is inconvenient.\n[2540.32] Modern Christianom.\n[2541.76] Yeah.\n[2542.40] I don't understand what what this point like if you didn't have white people, nobody would know about Harriet Tubman.\n[2548.08] You know why?\n[2549.04] She wouldn't have made it.\n[2550.08] We wouldn't let you write books about it, and you wouldn't be free.\n[2553.04] Mm-hmm.\n[2553.84] So maybe just saying thank you.\n[2556.24] You know who else is the benefit uh who's benefited from white supremacy?\n[2559.52] Um, the wealthiest celebrities on earth.\n[2561.92] There you go.\n[2562.48] Beyonce, NJZ, the top box office draws of the night, the uh Will Smith of the world, the Denzel Washington's of the world, the three most recognizable faces on earth in the 90s, Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson, kind of, that's a half one, Mike Tyson.\n[2576.08] Because white people you know who else?\n[2577.44] Barack Obama, president of the United States.\n[2579.28] I know that one's pretty crazy.\n[2580.72] That's rough.\n[2581.44] Also, white people, the ones who've given you the platform to speak these kinds of asinine opinions uh in a show like surrounded, not outnumbered.\n[2592.00] Surrounded.\n[2592.56] The next claim that she makes.\n[2595.28] That blacks absolutely do need reparations, and she's gonna make an airtight case.\n[2600.24] Now, let me land the plane.\n[2601.52] We're talking about reparations, and what you're doing is actually female pilot.\n[2606.32] The fact is reparations are just and necessary because on a basic level, black people built this country, and the country continues to thrive off of the labor that black people put into this country, and it would behoove you, young man, to really understand the way that your ancestors put blood, sweat, and tears into this nation that is still living off of those blood, sweat and tears.\n[2628.80] Okay, and I'll open this up to you guys, but here's the truth.\n[2630.72] All right, couple of things.\n[2631.76] I just addressed this, right?\n[2632.88] When you talk about EBT snap, section eight housing, more money to public schools, when you talk about affirmative action, DEI.\n[2638.32] These are all forms of reparations, to be clear.\n[2640.88] I think at some point she says repatriations.\n[2642.56] I'm not entirely sure she kind of delineates between the two.\n[2644.80] Remunerations.\n[2645.52] Is that what she says?\n[2646.08] Yeah, remunerations, sorry.\n[2647.36] Renumerations.\n[2648.48] Um.\n[2651.04] And she'll say, well, that's not what now we're asking for money.\n[2653.52] Okay, great, but those things exist because your community and the Democrat Party said that those were required.\n[2660.40] Okay?\n[2661.04] Those were required.\n[2662.00] That's the rep to the tune of trillions of dollars.\n[2664.88] Why is that not enough?\n[2666.16] And by the way, why do reparations need to be paid to a 15-year-old black guy?\n[2672.24] What kind of reparations does Jesse Smallett deserve?\n[2675.12] And is it wiped out by what he costs the good good taxpaying citizens of Chicago?\n[2680.96] I know you say you should defend him anyway because it's just a hoax.\n[2683.68] Oh, that's right.\n[2684.40] Now I'm getting it.\n[2685.44] The answer is always more money, please, more money, please.\n[2688.88] You asked for reparations.\n[2691.28] You may not like them now.\n[2692.56] It's what you asked for.\n[2694.64] You got them.\n[2696.64] You're saying it's not enough.\n[2698.88] Now you're on your own.\n[2700.40] The other thing is, by the way, I'm so tired of this.\n[2702.96] All references available, link in the descriptions.\n[2705.60] Um blacks built this country.\n[2708.08] No, they didn't.\n[2709.44] No, they didn't.\n[2710.64] In comparison to the labor in this country, and certainly in comparison to the businesses created and the innovations uh in this country, and yes, manual labor, especially if you look at the industrial revolution.\n[2722.48] You look at these great booms that took place in this country.\n[2725.28] It is not because of black people.\n[2728.56] They took part in it, but not any greater part than any well.\n[2732.72] 75%, by the way, of Southerners didn't own any slaves whatsoever.\n[2735.76] States like California never had any slaves, to be clear.\n[2738.96] And while we're talking about this, the vast majority of slaves, anywhere from 90% to 96%, I think the high number, 96% comes from Cornell West.\n[2747.68] Uh, they were sold into slavery by West African slave traders.\n[2752.40] Also, if you want to go buy yourself a slave today, you can still do it in plenty of African nations.\n[2757.76] You're gonna be dealing with a black person, though, so don't be surprised.\n[2761.36] Here's the next part of this is um slavery, too, actually can be argued through the metrics, it held the country back.\n[2770.00] The free North outperformed the South while they still had slaves in every way you could measure economically.\n[2778.08] The cotton industry exploded after slavery ended.\n[2781.52] Innovations like the cotton gin that came from the areas of the country that didn't have slavery.\n[2786.08] So this is something, and it's something that used to it's used to guilt white people.\n[2789.76] You wouldn't have this country if not for black people.\n[2792.08] Okay, well, black people, Africans who were sold by their African brothers.\n[2796.56] Hey, they're still there in countries in Africa.\n[2799.36] What does that look like?\n[2801.84] What's the difference?\n[2804.00] You have Africans and both.\n[2806.40] They're slaves in both.\n[2808.96] Slavery's wrong, to be clear, just like Hitler, bad.\n[2811.92] Africans in both slavery and slave owners alike in both.\n[2816.24] Pick a country, any country.\n[2818.64] The African continent, United States.\n[2820.56] What's the difference?\n[2821.52] Who built the country?\n[2824.08] One of the most infuriating things that she does is she makes these claims as though they're self-evident, right?\n[2829.20] She just says, yes, systemic racism exists.\n[2831.52] We were trying to think about, okay, well, how do you combat that without going down 50 rabbit holes?\n[2835.28] Okay, we'll go with what she said.\n[2836.40] Government prisons and schools.\n[2837.60] Okay, well, you can't prove that because we just disproved that.\n[2840.32] Reparations are absolutely just and needed.\n[2842.64] Okay, well, how do you prove that?\n[2844.08] Who gets it?\n[2845.04] Right.\n[2845.60] These people, we built this country, therefore, she goes to the next point as though that foundational statement is true.\n[2852.00] I just wish she would say something with some kind of factual backing.\n[2856.40] Quote a study, even if I don't agree with it, just something, a stat.\n[2860.00] Give me a number to go after.\n[2861.76] In fact, when the guy brought up statistics about black on black crime, she goes, stats lie all the time, honey.\n[2867.20] If you're gonna make your argument about stats, you already lost.\n[2870.08] Yeah.\n[2870.48] It's exactly what she did.\n[2871.44] It's like, oh, so I will never ever, you're just a racist person.\n[2874.64] Yeah.\n[2874.96] That's really what we're dealing with.\n[2876.08] They're a racist person who hates this country.\n[2878.24] Fantastic.\n[2878.88] Here's an offer from me.\n[2880.48] Not this show, from me personally.\n[2882.24] I will write you a check right now to pay to have you move to Africa.\n[2885.28] Let me Because apparently you don't like it here.\n[2887.20] Yeah.\n[2887.52] Let me ask you.\n[2888.08] I don't want to be, I don't want to be an oppressor.\n[2889.60] No, no, none of us do.\n[2890.48] Let me ask you this.\n[2891.04] If you went to Harriet Tubman back in time and said, hey, look, you can you can tomorrow, slavery is done.\n[2897.28] You don't have to do this railroad stuff.\n[2898.96] Okay, it's done.\n[2900.08] It's over.\n[2900.72] This railroad stuff.\n[2901.60] Everyone will be free.\n[2902.72] Everyone will be free.\n[2903.76] Oh, that's malarkey.\n[2905.04] But that's it.\n[2905.52] It's a fresh start.\n[2906.24] The only way we know how to do this, Miss Tubman, you've inspired us, is to break these chains.\n[2910.88] Slavery is done, but we just got to get a fresh start.\n[2912.80] We can't keep looking to the past.\n[2914.00] It's over.\n[2914.48] Everyone's free.\n[2915.68] Do you think of course she would take that deal.\n[2917.76] And if she saw seal, she would tell her to get a haircut and sew up the holes in her genes.\n[2921.60] Here's a bonus claim that she makes that uh just sort of shows that she's an actual racist.\n[2927.04] If you didn't know that by her defending Jesse Smollett because of his blackness, uh the claim here is that the Chinese aren't actual minorities or something like black people.\n[2936.32] I don't know.\n[2936.96] For example, we have the uh Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n[2939.68] We prevented Chinese people from getting citizenship and even entering the country, we discriminate against them, and basically put them under apartheid, even here in the United States.\n[2947.68] Yet they have the highest median household income.\n[2949.52] How is that possible?\n[2950.56] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to pay for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time?\n[2957.20] Which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2950.64] How come they don't complain and feel entitled consistently to beg for reparations and for this when they are killing each other 90% of the time, which is the rate that black people kill each other, according to the FBI.\n[2960.32] Oh, young Matt.\n[2961.60] One, comparing Chinese people who are immigrants that made a choice to come to the United States and comparing the continued effort of black people to ground themselves in a nation that continues to make impediments for them to show and live and exist in their true citizenship is a false equivalency.\n[2979.28] I don't believe that happens at all.\n[2980.24] What a what no one here is in the world?\n[2982.16] Are you acting right now?\n[2983.12] Do you really believe that?\n[2984.80] There's a way to try and discredit the person.\n[2986.88] Yeah.\n[2987.60] Now, before I get to the truth, let me just tell you this.\n[2989.68] I'm also, I think that you're placating by saying black people kill black people in record numbers.\n[2994.80] Because that's a you know what I'm actually really concerned with?\n[2997.92] I'm also really concerned with the fact that black people kill white people in this country in record numbers.\n[3002.40] It's not just your community's problem.\n[3004.64] No.\n[3005.28] And we have a right to an opinion because we are several times more likely to be assaulted, to be mugged, to be robbed, or to be killed by a black person as a white American than by a white American.\n[3015.20] Yep, the numbers are even higher because of the proximity effect of black people living around other black people.\n[3020.08] But let's be honest about this.\n[3022.40] We're concerned that we're more likely to be the victim of crime, and you can't blame it on there not being enough affirmative action.\n[3030.80] Anyone want to c anyone agree with that?\n[3032.64] I'm tired of going, oh, the black on black crime, they're the biggest yeah, sure, they're the biggest threat to the black community.\n[3037.44] I'm very concerned with them being a threat, that community to my white children.\n[3042.00] Got it.\n[3042.64] That's a great point because in this the the longer version of the video, you know, other people brought that up.\n[3049.04] And it is a real concern.\n[3050.40] But she her response was uh, well, how many how many black people do you see uh in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3056.32] A lot.\n[3056.64] How many white people do you see in your neighborhood on a day-to-day basis?\n[3058.96] Uh some.\n[3059.76] Well, uh that well, then that's not that's why.\n[3061.60] That's you're not you're not in danger from white people because you don't see white people.\n[3064.48] Yeah, yeah.\n[3065.12] The only problem is if you look at the armed robbery, you look at the burglaries, you look at the violent crime taking place in the white neighborhoods, you know, the next town over, you still see the same stats.\n[3075.20] In other words, these gangs of largely black people, they travel.\n[3080.08] And we have a problem with it.\n[3081.52] Brown round get around, they get around.\n[3084.24] The browns, browns, browns, browns, they get around.\n[3088.24] Shh.\n[3090.48] But here's the truth.\n[3091.84] Uh the Chinese in the United States.\n[3094.32] It's not a false equivalent.\n[3095.36] See, they weren't even considered citizens until 1943.\n[3098.24] 1870.\n[3099.44] Wow.\n[3099.76] Is when the 15th Amendment gave black men the right to vote, to be clear.\n[3104.16] 1920, the 19th Amendment, some would say a mistake granted black women the right to vote.\n[3109.12] Not because they're black, all women.\n[3110.88] And uh today, yes, the median income for Chinese Americans is 82,000 versus 54,000 for black Americans.\n[3117.68] So they've been discriminated against far more recently, in a way that would negatively affect their income.\n[3121.92] They bounce back.\n[3123.36] And by the way, richer than the average German, just to be clear.\n[3126.72] Like the Chinese do really well.\n[3128.72] You keep saying it wrong.\n[3130.08] The Chinese.\n[3130.88] Thanks.\n[3131.20] Sorry, it's pronounced Chinese.\n[3132.48] Finally admonish me.\n[3133.60] Yes.\n[3133.92] Admonish him alone.\n[3134.88] I don't want to be ethnocentric.\n[3136.72] Do it a lot.\n[3138.64] Chinese go down with the ship, Jim.\n[3141.04] And by the way, these metrics show you uh they Chinese, they know dumb.\n[3143.84] They are doing very well.\n[3146.48] So I don't know why it's plural in other countries, but it is.\n[3148.72] Hey, so what let's let's just concede the argument that she makes right now.\n[3152.16] I just want to concede every single point, right?\n[3153.84] I know we don't want to do that, but let's just concede.\n[3155.68] Every single thing you say about white people in this country, white supremacists and Harriet Tubman, systemic racism everywhere.\n[3162.00] You're right, you're owed every single dollar in my bank account.\n[3165.04] Do you think that's going to happen?\n[3167.76] And is that the best advice for all of your constituents to try to get that?\n[3172.72] Or let's just say that they're an oppressive system that they can never get out of, which is kind of what you're claiming in the first place.\n[3178.08] Wouldn't it be better to do what the other cultures have done and just try to make the very best of it that you possibly can and try to fix that instead of just complaining and shaking your fist at the sky and saying every bad thing that happens to you is because of the white man keeping you down?\n[3191.60] That's what works.\n[3192.88] You don't care about your community.\n[3194.48] Yeah.\n[3194.80] You care about having a grievance.\n[3196.40] You care about having an excuse for failure.\n[3199.60] Right.\n[3200.24] Instead of saying, hey, we need more fathers in the home in this community.\n[3204.16] Hey, we need less violence in this community.\n[3206.00] Hey, we need better education in this community.\n[3208.08] And guess what?\n[3208.96] Those people aren't gonna give it to us.\n[3210.64] Fine.\n[3211.12] We're gonna do it ourselves.\n[3212.32] Yeah.\n[3212.72] I tell you who really wants preparations.\n[3215.20] Chrysler.\n[3216.24] Oh, I thought you said pre I thought you said preparations, and I was thinking it's big H.\n[3220.48] No.\n[3221.36] No.\n[3221.84] Reparations.\n[3223.44] I'm not gonna say it.\n[3224.16] And by the way, bring up a bonus uh for uh those who are members of Rumble Premium for Mug Club.\n[3228.16] By the way, if you're not click that button below, we'll go on for another hour.\n[3231.44] Uh it's 99 dollars, you get everything ad-free, you get 100% more show, including the Friday show, and uh it's the only thing that keeps the lights on, or try for 999 a month, where they talked about with her uh black culture, and they talked about hip hop and the things that were glorified, and she said, Well, who's the one feeding black people that?\n[3248.48] Who's the one so if if they're force feeding you junk food, and in other words, it's white people who are largely responsible for the mass consumption in the black community and rejection by the way of any and all other forms of media as it relates to gangster culture as it relates to decadence and hedonism that you see.\n[3267.84] Um, I would have loved to ask her, what's on your playlist?\n[3271.36] Yeah.\n[3272.48] What do you think's on Jesse Smollett's playlist?\n[3274.80] Why have you been dubbed duped by the evil white man?\n[3278.08] I'm guessing Jew, right?\n[3279.36] Why have you been duped?\n[3281.68] It is our fault.\n[3282.56] Yeah.\n[3282.88] We men of the bucket and the mop.\n[3284.64] Yes.\n[3285.28] Yes.\n[3286.16] Yeah.\n[3286.88] It's uh, which is after which she modeled her hairdo.\n[3290.16] Um was the other thing.\n[3292.00] Do we have a do we have a left versus reality stinger, or is it a claim truth?\n[3296.64] Uh left.\n[3298.00] We don't have any stinger for this one.\n[3299.36] Oh we just have left versus things.\n[3301.20] Yeah.\n[3301.44] I can claim truth again, but really.\n[3307.20] You know, he's been making the rounds.\n[3308.72] He's been making a lot of progress.\n[3310.56] And yesterday, he met with some of the uh some people say Euro trash.\n[3315.52] I would never say that.\n[3316.24] Leaders in DC.\n[3317.84] And it all started off before we get to some of the claims from the left where they really want this administration to fail.\n[3324.32] And by that I mean they really want never-ending war.\n[3327.44] Um, it all kicked off with a warm welcome to Zelensky who put on a suit, sort of.\n[3333.60] I guess he got the message.\n[3347.76] Trump is on your message for the people of Ukraine.\n[3350.00] We're all right.\n[3351.76] We love them.\n[3353.04] We love them.\n[3360.48] Thank you very much, everybody goes.\n[3362.88] Couple of things there.\n[3363.92] First off, when he goes, this is the best I have, this suit, change it.\n[3368.24] That's why we think you're a disrespectful little prick.\n[3371.04] Stop by men's warehouse, get a two for one.\n[3375.12] And I look, look, this is the thing too.\n[3376.88] It's funny, right?\n[3377.52] Where people are talking about all cultures, hey, hey.\n[3380.40] It's a custom here.\n[3382.16] It just so happens to be a custom on the greatest country on earth.\n[3386.56] Put on a fucking suit.\n[3389.12] President Trump also, it's not a big deal.\n[3391.60] It's just respect our culture.\n[3393.44] You know.\n[3394.40] President Trump also, uh, by the way, was in rare form.\n[3397.12] Uh he had personalized greetings for each, I would never say Euro Trash leader.\n[3401.84] Everyone knows President Macron of France, who's been with me from the beginning, one of the first people I met as a foreign dignitary, and uh I like them from day one.\n[3414.88] And I like him even more now.\n[3416.56] That's pretty good.\n[3417.44] That's unusual.\n[3419.12] That's a pretty unusual thing.\n[3421.20] Prime Minister Maloney of Italy, who's a uh really great leader and an inspiration over there.\n[3427.84] She's uh she's served now, even though she's a very young person, she's served there for a long period of time relative to others.\n[3435.04] They don't they don't last very long.\n[3436.72] You've lasted a long time.\n[3438.40] You're gonna be there a long time.\n[3439.92] Chancellor Mertz of Germany, who is uh just put your Biden in this role person, right?\n[3446.48] And a very strong leader and very highly respected, and he's my friend, and it's another friend.\n[3453.28] Thank you very much.\n[3457.60] I want to I want to get a 10 like that.\n[3460.48] Where'd you get it?\n[3461.36] I get mine from a machine.\n[3464.24] I stand and go, whoa.\n[3466.32] Here's the thing.\n[3467.04] You may not like it, but the guy has something to offer in basic communications.\n[3473.20] Like well, but they got people to to laugh.\n[3475.12] You're there for a very serious subject.\n[3476.64] You compliment people, you got them laughing.\n[3478.96] He understands how to work a room.\n[3481.04] Well, one of the biggest lies that we were ever told, and they still try and sell is you know, we're being mocked, we're being uh we're we're the laughing stock of the international stage.\n[3489.12] Comment below.\n[3489.76] Does anyone actually believe that other leaders, the international community respected us more with Biden at the helm?\n[3497.04] Does anyone actually genuine comment?\n[3499.04] Right there, they're laughing and like, ah, this guy, you're in core you're incorrigible or whatever generic you're incorrigible.\n[3505.20] That's Finland.\n[3506.40] Wasn't Maloney the one that had to redirect him back to the meeting when they were doing the the D-Day memorial?\n[3512.72] I think so.\n[3513.52] She was the one that walked over and like grabbed him and was like, hey, by the way, be respectful.\n[3517.76] It's over here.\n[3518.64] Yeah.\n[3518.96] Yeah, exactly.\n[3519.60] This is where your country liberated our continent.\n[3522.32] Chocolate chip.\n[3524.08] By the way, so there were some all-time, all-time great photo ops, including President Trump showing off his hat collection.\n[3531.92] It's like, look, there's so many hats.\n[3534.88] That is hilarious.\n[3536.08] That was it's an episode of Gribs.\n[3538.64] That one right there goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3547.04] Still got uh it's a little blood there.\n[3540.48] Goes on my head.\n[3544.56] I wore this one when I was shot.\n[3546.96] Still got uh there's a little blood there.\n[3550.00] That's why it's red.\n[3551.04] I love that hat.\n[3552.48] I wish it's red on red, but it reminds me of the fact that I lived that God loves me more than you.\n[3567.76] Actually, all sport.\n[3569.12] I have to buy this on eBay.\n[3570.48] It's vintage.\n[3571.20] They stopped making it.\n[3572.32] Show the new Oval Office.\n[3573.52] This is where the magic happened.\n[3576.08] If you like it, it's all gold.\n[3577.92] I think it's a circle.\n[3579.04] Here's another uh picture.\n[3580.40] There's uh um what's in that the next one?\n[3583.28] Oh, yeah, this this picture of all the leaders gathered around the resolute desk.\n[3586.24] Look at that.\n[3587.12] They're all around there.\n[3587.84] I love how you like crammed him in.\n[3589.04] Like, you can all get closer.\n[3590.32] I need all this space.\n[3592.24] And uh the best.\n[3593.84] Here's a cap uh caption uh on X, because we put this out there.\n[3597.92] Um who posed can you bring it up?\n[3599.44] Who posted this?\n[3600.24] Huge huge wrote uh when you and your boys get caught being the weak men who create hard times.\n[3607.52] A runner up to it, uh Cole Hetty Lamar uh wrote Maloney.\n[3611.52] I was told there would be antipasto.\n[3616.72] I still don't fully know what that's it's like uh it's like appetizers in Italy.\n[3620.64] Yes, yes, okay.\n[3621.44] Well now I think she's the Italian, yeah.\n[3623.20] I just thought it was like something that didn't like the pasta.\n[3626.24] Okay, hey, and it's like cheese and wine and stuff like that.\n[3630.08] It's not enough to be anti this thing.\n[3631.92] You gotta get your own thing.\n[3633.20] Now, this picture may have been the best one right here.\n[3636.48] Look at that.\n[3636.96] It's the worst Avengers movie ever.\n[3641.28] But to be clear, they were also getting ready for the evening's festivities.\n[3645.12] I want it.\n[3649.44] We figure we throw it in.\n[3651.12] That's cohesion, huh?\n[3652.08] Yeah, no.\n[3653.60] So, and we're going to get to you're wrong about everything here, and the references are all available link in the description.\n[3659.60] This means that legacy media, seeing the man who's not supposed to be respected by the international community being unilaterally respected by the international community, seeing the man who was supposed to be a feckless, ineffective celebrity president being incredibly effective and accomplishing what no other leader's been able to do for years.\n[3675.68] Um, well, that made them spurg, and that means that they're completely up in arms, uh, accusing Donald Trump of abandoning Europe, doing Putin's bidding, you know, the same tired talking points that don't really apply, but they still try and apply him.\n[3688.64] The president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, decided to have a meeting with him, and then decided to invite him to the United States of America.\n[3697.60] He didn't have to do that.\n[3698.80] And then you're showing it, rolled out literally a red carpet for him.\n[3703.20] Putin clearly won.\n[3704.48] There's no world in which Donald Trump he doesn't like multilateral meetings because he likes to be able to bully people on their own.\n[3709.92] It's unusual.\n[3711.28] All the stuff you just saw doesn't even happen for our democratic allies.\n[3714.88] Got a flyover, a red carpet, fly.\n[3716.96] A lot of handshakes.\n[3718.32] A lot of great state TV coverage back called.\n[3720.80] How many times have you seen any of our democratic allies or NATO allies or allies in Asia treated like that?\n[3727.20] It doesn't even have to be.\n[3768.32] From former U.S.\n[3769.28] Secretary of State and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, here's what she has to say.\n[3775.28] This post she just put out a short time ago.\n[3777.68] She says, if Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.\n[3788.32] Does this let me ask you this?\n[3789.44] Does this actually work on anybody?\n[3791.04] Does that kind of assholery work on anybody?\n[3794.24] If if without Ukraine ceding any territory, tell me when that's ever happened in the history of mankind.\n[3799.92] An inferior nation militarily, and if not for Western Mike coming to help them, coming to terms in a war that they're losing without compromising anything.\n[3810.72] Oh, okay.\n[3811.60] You're trying to set up a standard that could never possibly be met.\n[3814.48] And as the as for the man saying they're gonna gaslight.\n[3818.24] Do you mean like gaslighting in the way that you said these leaders wouldn't meet with Donald Trump in the way that you said these leaders have no respect for President Trump?\n[3828.08] Because we're going to get to the exact words from these leaders while they were all meeting on one side of the table with Donald Trump.\n[3835.36] And let's keep that in mind, the word gaslighting.\n[3837.60] It's time for why everything you say.\n[3841.12] You're wrong about everything.\n[3846.48] Wrong.\n[3847.76] All right, let's start with the left.\n[3849.52] So what they say is that Friday's meeting with Putin was stupid, pointless, and uh something.\n[3854.96] Well, I think last Friday, that Alaska summit was one of the most disastrous summits that I can think of.\n[3860.64] Oh no.\n[3861.44] Uh did no good in terms of advancing America's interests or the interests of our allies or Ukraine.\n[3867.60] And we treated this horrible dictator who terrorizes Ukrainians every single night, as you just showed by killing them through these attacks on civilians.\n[3877.92] Uh, we treated him like he was some special uh friend of the United States.\n[3882.08] Okay, here's the reality.\n[3883.76] Okay.\n[3884.96] The NATO Secretary General Mark Root thanked President Trump.\n[3888.48] He didn't say it's completely pointless, rolled out a red carpet.\n[3891.52] He thanked President Trump for being the only person in years to finally break the deadlock.\n[3899.68] His words.\n[3907.36] Basically, uh with President Putin by starting the dialogue.\n[3910.96] And I think it was in February that you had to first phone call, and from there, we are now where we are today.\n[3917.28] Uh and that is uh, I think if we play this well, we could end it.\n[3921.52] And we have to end it.\n[3922.56] We have to stop the killing, we have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure.\n[3926.88] It is a terrible war.\n[3928.48] Um, so I'm I'm really excited.\n[3930.80] By the way, that man's not a conservative as you would know it to be in the United States.\n[3935.20] So you have the left in the United States.\n[3937.12] This is not it's accomplished nothing.\n[3938.48] He's sucking up to him, and you have that man, the man who would know, thanking President Trump for breaking the deadlock.\n[3947.12] Does that sound like we're less respected in the international?\n[3950.24] You know who didn't break the deadlock?\n[3952.16] Biden.\n[3952.96] Here's another one.\n[3953.84] The left.\n[3954.56] They claim that President Trump is still sucking up to Putin.\n[3959.20] What the Europeans are coming to give Trump some support, some ballast.\n[3963.92] By the way, join Rumble Premium because we have to go.\n[3965.68] We're running late.\n[3966.16] If not, you're gonna see Tim Poole.\n[3967.52] Cut it.\n[3968.08] I mean, I'm not sure.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

The video clip is precisely aligned with the transcript below:\n- The video starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The transcript starts at 0.00 seconds\n- Both are synchronized in the same normalized time coordinate system\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the video frames to visually identify the exact moment boundaries. Look for:\n- Visual cues that indicate the start of the topic/segment\n- Scene changes, speaker changes, or visual transitions\n- The exact frame where the engaging content begins and ends\n- Correlation between what you see and what you hear in the transcript\n\nAnalyze BOTH the video frames and the word-level transcript to determine the most accurate timestamps. The timestamps you output should match this normalized coordinate system (starting from 0.00).\n\nTASK CONTEXT:\nYou are refining the timestamps for an existing video moment. The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Zelensky meeting and left's hypocritical reaction\"\n- Current start time: 29.68 seconds\n- Current end time: 129.68 seconds\n\nIMPORTANT - COORDINATE SYSTEM:\nAll timestamps (transcript, video, and the current moment times above) are in the SAME normalized coordinate system:\n- The clip starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The clip ends at 159.84 seconds\n- Both the transcript and video are aligned to this coordinate system\n- Your output timestamps must also be in this coordinate system (0.00 to 159.84)\n\nThe current timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps.
