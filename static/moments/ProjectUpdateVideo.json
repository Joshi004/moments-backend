Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nNone\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps.

to\n[3.92-4.32] walk\n[4.32-4.56] you\n[4.56-4.80] through\n[4.80-4.96] the\n[4.96-5.28] full\n[5.28-5.60] story\n[5.60-5.84] of\n[5.84-6.00] where\n[6.00-6.16] we\n[6.16-6.32] are\n[6.32-6.48] with\n[6.48-6.56] the\n[6.56-7.04] Rumble\n[7.04-7.36] AI\n[7.36-7.60] project,\n[7.68-7.84] what\n[7.84-7.92] we\n[7.92-8.00] are\n[8.00-8.24] trying\n[8.24-8.32] to\n[8.32-8.64] achieve,\n[8.80-8.96] what\n[8.96-9.12] we\n[9.12-9.28] have\n[9.28-9.84] completed\n[9.84-10.00] so\n[10.00-10.16] far,\n[10.32-10.48] the\n[10.48-11.04] challenges\n[11.04-11.28] we\n[11.28-11.44] have\n[11.44-12.08] identified,\n[12.16-12.32] what\n[12.32-12.56] we\n[12.56-12.72] are\n[12.72-13.36] actively\n[13.36-13.68] working\n[13.68-13.92] on,\n[14.00-14.32] and\n[14.32-14.48] what\n[14.48-14.80] we\n[14.80-15.04] plan\n[15.04-15.20] to\n[15.20-15.44] do\n[15.44-15.92] next.\n[16.16-16.56] Let's\n[16.56-16.96] begin\n[16.96-17.20] with\n[17.20-17.36] the\n[17.36-17.68] vision\n[17.68-18.00] behind\n[18.00-18.24] the\n[18.24-18.72] project.\n[18.96-19.28] To\n[19.28-19.60] start\n[19.60-19.84] with,\n[20.16-20.48] our\n[20.48-21.20] objective\n[21.20-21.36] is\n[21.36-21.60] to\n[21.60-21.92] build\n[21.92-22.24] an\n[22.24-22.88] end-to-end\n[23.04-23.44] AI\n[23.44-23.84] solution\n[23.84-24.08] for\n[24.08-24.64] Rumble\n[24.64-25.04] videos.\n[25.12-25.28] In\n[25.28-25.44] the\n[25.44-25.60] first\n[25.60-25.92] phase,\n[26.00-26.16] we\n[26.16-26.32] are\n[26.32-26.96] focusing\n[26.96-27.12] on\n[27.12-27.36] two\n[27.36-27.60] key\n[27.60-28.16] capabilities.\n[28.32-28.64] The\n[28.64-28.88] first\n[28.88-29.12] is\n[29.12-29.36] to\n[29.36-30.16] automatically\n[30.16-30.64] generate\n[30.64-31.04] short\n[31.12-31.84] engaging\n[31.84-32.24] moments\n[32.24-32.48] for\n[32.48-33.20] long-term\n[33.20-33.68] videos\n[33.68-33.92] to\n[33.92-34.24] help\n[34.24-34.80] increase\n[34.80-35.12] user\n[35.12-35.60] engagement.\n[35.76-35.92] The\n[35.92-36.40] second\n[36.40-36.64] is\n[36.64-36.80] to\n[36.80-37.12] create\n[37.12-37.36] a\n[37.36-37.60] video\n[37.76-38.24] aware\n[38.24-38.56] search\n[38.56-39.12] experience,\n[39.36-39.68] one\n[39.68-39.92] that\n[39.92-40.32] goes\n[40.32-40.96] beyond\n[40.96-41.28] video\n[41.28-41.68] titles\n[41.68-41.92] and\n[41.92-42.56] metadata\n[42.56-42.80] and\n[42.80-43.28] actually\n[43.28-43.92] understands\n[43.92-44.16] the\n[44.16-44.64] content\n[44.64-45.12] inside\n[45.12-45.44] a\n[45.44-45.68] video.\n[45.84-46.08] With\n[46.08-46.32] this\n[46.32-46.72] vision\n[46.72-47.04] in\n[47.04-47.28] place,\n[47.52-47.76] we\n[47.76-47.92] have\n[47.92-48.32] already\n[48.32-48.64] made\n[48.64-48.80] a\n[48.80-49.20] strong\n[49.20-49.68] progress.\n[49.84-50.16] Over\n[50.16-50.32] the\n[50.32-50.56] past\n[50.56-50.80] few\n[50.80-51.20] weeks,\n[51.36-51.60] we\n[51.60-51.76] have\n[51.76-52.16] built\n[52.16-52.64] multiple\n[52.64-53.44] prototypes\n[53.44-53.68] that\n[53.68-54.16] function\n[54.16-54.32] as\n[54.32-54.48] a\n[54.48-55.04] separate\n[55.04-55.52] service\n[55.52-56.08] within\n[56.08-56.32] our\n[56.32-56.88] large\n[56.88-57.20] moment\n[57.28-57.84] generation\n[57.84-58.00] system.\n[58.16-58.40] We\n[58.40-58.88] started\n[58.88-59.04] by\n[59.04-59.76] conducting\n[59.76-60.32] extensive\n[60.32-60.80] research\n[60.80-61.04] and\n[61.04-61.76] transcription\n[61.76-62.16] generation,\n[62.40-63.20] identified\n[63.20-63.44] what\n[63.44-63.92] works\n[63.92-64.16] best\n[64.16-64.48] for\n[64.48-64.72] our\n[64.72-65.04] use\n[65.04-65.36] case,\n[65.44-65.68] and\n[65.68-66.00] even\n[66.00-66.40] shared\n[66.40-66.56] the\n[66.56-66.88] results\n[66.88-67.04] with\n[67.04-67.60] Rumble\n[67.76-67.92] to\n[67.92-68.24] help\n[68.24-68.96] unblo\n[68.96-68.96] their\n[69.12-69.76] transcription\n[69.76-70.32] pipeline\n[70.32-70.80] updates.\n[70.88-71.12] In\n[71.12-71.68] parallel,\n[71.92-72.08] we\n[72.08-72.72] developed\n[72.72-73.52] prototypes\n[73.52-73.76] for\n[73.76-74.16] audio\n[74.16-74.72] captioning,\n[74.96-75.28] video\n[75.28-75.92] captioning\n[76.00-76.24] and\n[76.24-76.80] emotion\n[76.80-77.60] analysis\n[77.60-78.00] using\n[78.00-78.40] audio\n[78.40-78.88] captions.\n[78.96-79.28] And\n[79.28-79.52] we\n[79.52-79.76] also\n[79.76-80.48] explored\n[80.48-81.04] relevant\n[81.04-81.60] research\n[81.60-82.24] papers\n[82.24-82.72] already\n[82.72-83.28] addressing\n[83.28-83.36] the\n[83.36-83.76] similar\n[83.76-84.16] challenges.\n[84.32-85.04] Additionally,\n[85.36-85.60] we\n[85.60-86.40] evaluated\n[86.40-86.88] several\n[86.88-87.44] external\n[87.44-88.08] vendors\n[88.08-88.32] to\n[88.32-88.80] understand\n[88.80-89.20] whether\n[89.20-89.44] they\n[89.44-89.68] could\n[89.68-90.24] accelerate\n[90.24-90.32] the\n[90.32-90.88] development.\n[91.04-91.36] After\n[91.36-92.08] analyzing\n[92.08-92.32] their\n[92.32-92.96] strategies\n[92.96-93.68] alongside\n[93.68-93.92] our\n[93.92-94.56] findings,\n[94.80-94.96] we\n[94.96-95.68] concluded\n[95.68-95.92] that\n[95.92-96.16] an\n[96.16-96.72] iterative\n[96.72-97.36] in-house\n[97.36-97.76] approach\n[97.92-98.48] supported\n[98.48-98.64] by\n[98.64-98.80] a\n[98.80-99.36] slightly\n[99.36-99.84] large\n[99.84-100.40] internal\n[100.40-100.88] team\n[100.88-101.12] is\n[101.12-101.36] the\n[101.36-101.60] best\n[101.60-101.92] path\n[101.92-102.56] forward.\n[102.96-103.52] Now,\n[103.68-104.16] through\n[104.16-104.40] all\n[104.40-104.72] this\n[104.72-104.96] work,\n[105.04-105.20] we\n[105.20-105.44] have\n[105.44-105.84] gained\n[105.84-106.48] clarity\n[106.48-106.56] on\n[106.56-106.72] the\n[106.72-107.04] key\n[107.04-107.68] challenges\n[107.68-107.92] we\n[107.92-108.24] must\n[108.24-108.80] solve\n[108.80-108.96] to\n[108.96-109.36] reach\n[109.36-109.60] high\n[109.68-110.24] quality\n[110.24-110.88] results.\n[111.12-111.44] Two\n[111.44-111.60] of\n[111.60-111.76] the\n[111.76-112.24]
