The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Research Progress and Prototype Development for Transcription and Captioning\"\n- Current start time: 46.00 seconds\n- Current end time: 103.12 seconds\n\nThe timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps.

No exceptions.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n- Your response MUST start with [ and MUST end with ]\n- Do NOT output a JSON object { }\n- Do NOT output ANY explanation, notes, thoughts, reasoning, validation, analysis, or commentary\n- Do NOT output <think> tags, <think> tags, hidden chain-of-thought, or any text before or after the array\n- Do NOT include transcript data, rules, validation, analysis, notes, or any other fields\n- Do NOT repeat the same data multiple times\n- Do NOT wrap the array in an object\n- Your response must be ONLY: [ ... ] - nothing before, nothing after\n\nIf you need to think, think internally—but the output must ONLY be the JSON array.\n\nCRITICAL: Output ONLY the JSON array. No wrapper object. No other fields. Just [ ... ].\n\nTASK CONTEXT:\nYou are refining the timestamps for an existing video moment. The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Research Progress and Prototype Development for Transcription and Captioning\"\n- Current start time: 46.00 seconds\n- Current end time: 103.12 seconds\n\nThe timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps.
