amount to get to.\n[185.04] Um noted Christian sodomite Don Lemon.\n[188.40] We're gonna talk about him a little bit more.\n[189.92] Our charges coming.\n[191.20] The betting odds say absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims regarding housing prices that I strongly disagree with.\n[247.76] And I will make the case.\n[249.20] So my question to you is why is Ben wrong on with the show.\n[260.40] No, I'm glad you called.\n[261.92] This is nice.\n[264.24] Yeah.\n[264.88] I am too.\n[265.60] I really miss this.\n[269.44] Hey Dad.\n[271.36] Remember when uh scored all those touchdowns in the state championship game?\n[276.00] Yeah.\n[277.12] I love it, man.\n[278.00] I was really proud of you then.\n[280.88] Love you, son.\n[282.40] Love you too.\n[285.04] But that's not how the reunion really went down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

poorly.\n[421.20] I blame Apple Jack because there's a sickness going around.\n[424.00] Yeah, he's he's got this weird vibe in here right now.\n[426.88] Yeah, yeah.\n[427.52] Like he has to notify everyone, you know, who's his new neighbor, or he can't live within 50 yards of a grade school.\n[433.04] Yeah, did he tell you about that?\n[434.32] No, it's just a vibe.\n[435.20] Oh, okay.\n[435.68] It's just a vibe.\n[436.56] But we love him anyway.\n[441.20] So uh and Captain Morgan's not here either, so we uh wish uh noodles with speedy recovery, Captain Morgan, uh CEO had a different uh scheduled whatever.\n[451.04] Uh Lane cool and Oscar.\n[453.68] I just got thrown off by Rise and Shine.\n[455.28] I know it's because we were talking about cool running so it was Rise and Shine, it's butt kicking time, and then it just got in my brain, and Lane the Brain is uh here.\n[462.00] How are you doing, sir?\n[462.96] Good, good.\n[463.84] Have some real estate viewings in Greenland.\n[465.92] Very nice.\n[466.40] So good.\n[467.20] Big things on the horizon.\n[468.40] Yeah, well, I hear the fishing is fantastic because you can just kill whatever you want.\n[472.56] Perfect.\n[473.12] Yeah.\n[473.60] And uh that's because we allow special set asides for uh them Eskimos.\n[479.20] Uh Saturday, February 14th, he's going to be at the Irve Theater in Dallas, Texas, not underscore Fire Stein, and uh he's here because uh, well, you know.\n[488.72] I was popped out from his loins, uh Pop Scrouder.\n[492.48] How are you, sir?\n[493.04] Good, he's here because Gerald is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

different uh scheduled whatever.\n[451.04] Uh Lane cool and Oscar.\n[453.68] I just got thrown off by Rise and Shine.\n[455.28] I know it's because we were talking about cool running so it was Rise

is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

amount to get to.\n[185.04] Um noted Christian sodomite Don Lemon.\n[188.40] We're gonna talk about him a little bit more.\n[189.92] Our charges coming.\n[191.20] The betting odds say absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims regarding housing prices that I strongly disagree with.\n[247.76] And I will make the case.\n[249.20] So my question to you is why is Ben wrong on with the show.\n[260.40] No, I'm glad you called.\n[261.92] This is nice.\n[264.24] Yeah.\n[264.88] I am too.\n[265.60] I really miss this.\n[269.44] Hey Dad.\n[271.36] Remember when uh scored all those touchdowns in the state championship game?\n[276.00] Yeah.\n[277.12] I love it, man.\n[278.00] I was really proud of you then.\n[280.88] Love you, son.\n[282.40] Love you too.\n[285.04] But that's not how the reunion really went down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation,

uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

Perfect.\n[473.12] Yeah.\n[473.60] And uh that's because we allow special set asides for uh them Eskimos.\n[479.20] Uh Saturday, February 14th, he's going to be at the Irve Theater in Dallas, Texas, not underscore Fire Stein, and uh he's here because uh, well, you know.\n[488.72] I was popped out from his loins, uh Pop Scrouder.\n[492.48] How are you, sir?\n[493.04] Good, he's here because Gerald is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them

amount to get to.\n[185.04] Um noted Christian sodomite Don Lemon.\n[188.40] We're gonna talk about him a little bit more.\n[189.92] Our charges coming.\n[191.20] The betting odds say absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims regarding housing prices that I strongly disagree with.\n[247.76] And I will make the case.\n[249.20] So my question to you is why is Ben wrong on with the show.\n[260.40] No, I'm glad you

game?\n[276.00] Yeah.\n[277.12] I love it, man.\n[278.00] I was really proud of you then.\n[280.88] Love you, son.\n[282.40] Love you too.\n[285.04] But that's not how the reunion really went down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

poorly.\n[421.20] I blame Apple Jack because there's a sickness going around.\n[424.00] Yeah, he's he's got this weird vibe in here right now.\n[426.88] Yeah, yeah.\n[427.52] Like he has to notify everyone, you know, who's his new neighbor, or he can't live within 50 yards of a grade school.\n[433.04] Yeah, did he tell you about that?\n[434.32] No, it's just a vibe.\n[435.20] Oh,

different uh scheduled whatever.\n[451.04] Uh Lane cool and Oscar.\n[453.68] I just got thrown off by Rise and Shine.\n[455.28] I know it's because we were talking about cool running so it was Rise and Shine, it's butt kicking time, and then it just got in my brain, and Lane the Brain is uh here.\n[462.00] How are you doing, sir?\n[462.96] Good, good.\n[463.84] Have some real estate viewings in

Perfect.\n[473.12] Yeah.\n[473.60] And uh that's because we allow special set asides for uh them Eskimos.\n[479.20] Uh Saturday, February 14th, he's going to be at the Irve Theater in Dallas, Texas,

is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims regarding housing prices that I strongly disagree with.\n[247.76] And I will make the case.\n[249.20] So my question to you is why is Ben wrong on with the show.\n[260.40] No, I'm glad you

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

shine.\n[414.56] It's not rise or shine.\n[415.68] No, I know it's rise and shine.\n[416.80] It's a totally separate expression.\n[418.00] Yeah, yeah.\n[418.56] And I uh this is started off uh poorly.\n[421.20] I blame Apple Jack because there's a sickness going around.\n[424.00] Yeah, he's he's got this weird vibe in here right now.\n[426.88] Yeah, yeah.\n[427.52] Like he has to notify everyone, you know, who's his new neighbor, or he can't live within 50 yards of a grade school.\n[433.04] Yeah, did he tell you about that?\n[434.32] No, it's just a vibe.\n[435.20] Oh, okay.\n[435.68] It's just a vibe.\n[436.56] But we love him anyway.\n[441.20] So uh and Captain Morgan's not here either, so we uh wish uh noodles with speedy recovery, Captain Morgan, uh CEO had a different uh scheduled whatever.\n[451.04] Uh Lane cool and Oscar.\n[453.68] I just got thrown off by Rise and Shine.\n[455.28] I know it's because we were talking about cool running so it was Rise and Shine, it's butt kicking time, and then it just got in my brain, and Lane the Brain is uh here.\n[462.00] How are you doing, sir?\n[462.96] Good, good.\n[463.84] Have some real estate viewings in Greenland.\n[465.92] Very nice.\n[466.40] So good.\n[467.20] Big things on the horizon.\n[468.40] Yeah, well, I hear the fishing is fantastic because you can just kill whatever you want.\n[472.56] Perfect.\n[473.12] Yeah.\n[473.60] And uh that's because we allow special set asides for uh them Eskimos.\n[479.20] Uh Saturday, February 14th, he's going to be at the Irve Theater in Dallas, Texas, not underscore Fire Stein, and uh he's here because uh, well, you know.\n[488.72] I was popped out from his loins, uh Pop Scrouder.\n[492.48] How are you, sir?\n[493.04] Good, he's here because Gerald is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

Perfect.\n[473.12] Yeah.\n[473.60] And uh that's because we allow special set asides for uh them Eskimos.\n[479.20] Uh Saturday, February 14th, he's going to be at the Irve Theater in Dallas, Texas,

is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

amount to get to.\n[185.04] Um noted Christian sodomite Don Lemon.\n[188.40] We're gonna talk about him a little bit more.\n[189.92] Our charges coming.\n[191.20] The betting odds say absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims regarding housing prices that I strongly disagree with.\n[247.76] And I will make the case.\n[249.20] So my question to you is why is Ben wrong on with the show.\n[260.40] No, I'm glad you

game?\n[276.00] Yeah.\n[277.12] I love it, man.\n[278.00] I was really proud of you then.\n[280.88] Love you, son.\n[282.40] Love you too.\n[285.04] But that's not how the reunion really went down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

everyone, you know, who's his new neighbor, or he can't live within 50 yards of a grade school.\n[433.04] Yeah, did he tell you about that?\n[434.32] No, it's just a vibe.\n[435.20] Oh,

different uh scheduled whatever.\n[451.04] Uh Lane cool and Oscar.\n[453.68] I just got thrown off by Rise and Shine.\n[455.28] I know it's because we were talking about cool running so it was Rise

you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

poorly.\n[421.20] I blame Apple Jack because there's a sickness going around.\n[424.00] Yeah, he's he's got this weird vibe in here right now.\n[426.88] Yeah, yeah.\n[427.52] Like he has to notify everyone, you know, who's his new neighbor, or he can't live within 50 yards of a grade school.\n[433.04] Yeah, did he tell you about that?\n[434.32] No, it's just a vibe.\n[435.20] Oh,

different uh scheduled whatever.\n[451.04] Uh Lane cool and Oscar.\n[453.68] I just got thrown off by Rise and Shine.\n[455.28] I know it's because we were talking about cool running so it was Rise and Shine, it's butt kicking time, and then it just got in my brain, and Lane the Brain is uh here.\n[462.00] How are you doing, sir?\n[462.96] Good, good.\n[463.84] Have some real estate viewings in Greenland.\n[465.92] Very nice.\n[466.40] So good.\n[467.20] Big things on the horizon.\n[468.40] Yeah, well, I hear the fishing is fantastic because you can just kill whatever you want.\n[472.56] Perfect.\n[473.12] Yeah.\n[473.60] And uh that's because we allow special set asides for uh them Eskimos.\n[479.20] Uh Saturday, February 14th, he's going to be at the Irve Theater in Dallas, Texas,

is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

amount to get to.\n[185.04] Um noted Christian sodomite Don Lemon.\n[188.40] We're gonna talk about him a little bit more.\n[189.92] Our charges coming.\n[191.20] The betting odds say absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims regarding housing prices that I strongly disagree with.\n[247.76] And I will make the case.\n[249.20] So my question to you is why is Ben wrong on with the show.\n[260.40] No, I'm glad you called.\n[261.92] This is nice.\n[264.24] Yeah.\n[264.88] I am too.\n[265.60] I really miss this.\n[269.44] Hey Dad.\n[271.36] Remember when uh scored all those touchdowns in the state championship game?\n[276.00] Yeah.\n[277.12] I love it, man.\n[278.00] I was really proud of you then.\n[280.88] Love you, son.\n[282.40] Love you too.\n[285.04] But that's not how the reunion really went down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working

you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims

down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

Perfect.\n[473.12] Yeah.\n[473.60] And uh that's because we allow special set asides for uh them Eskimos.\n[479.20] Uh Saturday, February 14th, he's going to be at the Irve Theater in Dallas, Texas, not underscore Fire Stein, and uh he's here because uh, well, you know.\n[488.72] I was popped out from his loins, uh Pop Scrouder.\n[492.48] How are you, sir?\n[493.04] Good, he's here because Gerald is not.\n[494.72] That's right.\n[495.44] That's right.\n[495.84] We figure we need a creepier old guy.\n[497.92] Uh and uh you also, by the way, there's a promo going on right now, the the site that you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

amount to get to.\n[185.04] Um noted Christian sodomite Don Lemon.\n[188.40] We're gonna talk about him a little bit more.\n[189.92] Our charges coming.\n[191.20] The betting odds say absolutely.\n[193.44] So that's fun.\n[194.64] Uh we're also gonna be talking about hey, you know, Greenland, everyone's discussing this right now.\n[198.32] Are you aware of the history of Greenland?\n[200.88] Hey, are you aware of the history of the Vikings?\n[204.08] I don't know if you know this.\n[205.36] Um, not a particularly friendly brood, the Vikings.\n[209.44] So the the point is this someone has and will be colonizing Greenland because it's 50,000 Eskimos.\n[217.44] What are they gonna do?\n[219.20] Why not the United States?\n[221.60] Considering that we're gonna be footing the bill for the defense.\n[224.08] We're actually gonna walk you through the history of Greenland a little bit and why this uh not really is eight D chess, but it's just a case as to you know, it's ours now.\n[234.80] Ben Shapiro, uh, you know, he's been on the show.\n[237.52] He's welcome to come on the show.\n[239.04] He just uh was on Gavin Newsom's podcast and uh made some claims regarding housing prices that I strongly disagree with.\n[247.76] And I will make the case.\n[249.20] So my question to you is why is Ben wrong on with the show.\n[260.40] No, I'm glad you

game?\n[276.00] Yeah.\n[277.12] I love it, man.\n[278.00] I was really proud of you then.\n[280.88] Love you, son.\n[282.40] Love you too.\n[285.04] But that's not how the reunion really went down.\n[288.64] You see, Timmy never played in that state championship.\n[292.08] He never even made the team.\n[294.32] You see, his parents suffered from crippling debt and skyrocketing inflation, and they were never able to buy that nice new house on the east side.\n[300.96] Their debt led to marital stress, culminating in a messy divorce, leaving Timmy to raise himself while mom was working three jobs.\n[308.72] Let's see how the reunion actually went down.\n[315.52] Give me your phone and you wallet, old man.\n[317.60] I don't have anything on me now.\n[318.72] Hurry up!\n[319.28] I

everyone, you know, who's his new neighbor, or he can't live within 50 yards of a grade school.\n[433.04] Yeah, did he tell you about that?\n[434.32] No, it's just a vibe.\n[435.20] Oh,

different uh scheduled whatever.\n[451.04] Uh Lane cool and Oscar.\n[453.68] I just got thrown off by Rise and Shine.\n[455.28] I know it's because we were talking about cool running so it was Rise

you've created, spearheaded shout-out, shout-out.us if you use the promo code promo code shout for 20% off.\n[506.48] Yeah.\n[506.80] It's kind of like uh cameo, only not communist.\n[509.04] Is that uh the elevator pitch?\n[511.12] That's a very short elevator.\n[512.88] One floor elevator pitch, yes.\n[514.40] Well, you're not throwing your lunar when those communists are all right.\n[520.24] Hey, remember that cookie sheet yeah uh lady yesterday?\n[522.64] Oh yeah.\n[523.28] Remember she was wearing that the fun oven mit lady with the it was a broiler.\n[527.52] Yeah, she screamed bangarang and she was rolled down a ship deck.\n[531.60] Yes.\n[533.12] Well, the good news is, you know, we thought, hey, you know what, this is a little bit um it's a little bit uniform as far as the color with these protesters, namely white ladies.\n[541.68] Um and so here's more of that.\n[543.52] Here's another white savior uh from Minneapolis.\n[546.32] Uh it gets worse.\n[548.48] Federal officials say the government is doing its job, enforcing the law, protecting the biggest.\n[553.84] Hey, two whistles.\n[556.24] I swear.\n[556.96] This one's really cool, and it has pink and blue.\n[563.20] Oh boy.\n[566.08] Her car heart overalls that she's never worked in.\n[581.04] Cafe has multiple purposes.\n[582.64] Yes, yeah, ice, ice, oh fuck ice.\n[586.40] We are gonna play it nice.\n[588.16] Uh, you run a sucking daddy.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what it get the gear and get outside.\n[591.04] Well, precisely nothing.\n[592.88] Not make friends.\n[594.32] And she kills the energy here.\n[596.24] Yeah, what is get the gear?\n[599.20] And get outside.\n[600.80] Get the moisturizer.\n[602.32] Get the Oshkosh Bagosh.\n[604.96] My cat clean his crotch.\n[609.12] So before we get to look, every single style choice included there is impractical and will give her worse odds of surviving.\n[619.28] So flat bottom sneakers with likely no tread.\n[621.84] That's horrible on eye.\n[622.80] She's not even wearing the appropriate boots.\n[624.24] You think about SWAT teams, you think about you know, sort of more modern, specialized gear uh with maybe some stretch.\n[630.56] She's wearing overalls, which by the way guarantees that she will be less mobile because it's a one piece and uh it's incredibly stiff.\n[637.68] Yeah.\n[638.00] Uh then she decides she's gonna wear a shoulder strap, which you know, if you have a shoulder strap bag, uh the benefit there would be you can carry more gear, but instead decides to go with one the size of a fanny pack, which is actually usually that size because of its limitations.\n[651.12] So she's getting the worst of all worlds, and then of course the cafe or poncho, whatever it is, it has uh tassels that are highly flammable, so they can just kind of catch the edge of it as they light her ablaze, her hair not tied up, the goggles and mask too loose.\n[665.68] This lady's probably going to die.\n[668.88] She brought whistles and a gas mask.\n[670.88] How are you gonna use both?\n[672.08] I don't know.\n[673.04] Yeah, I don't know how that works.\n[674.80] Is there a whistle hole?\n[676.88] No, there's not.\n[678.16] Whistles, gas mask, and uh and and and tassels.\n[681.60] Yeah, so you can pull on them.\n[682.80] She's yank her down.\n[683.92] She's prepared for war.\n[685.76] Yeah.\n[686.72] It's all about the look, though.\n[687.84] It's uh it's the the perception.\n[689.28] It's like a fake martial arts.\n[690.72] She she got the camera all lined up and she's she's going to war.\n[693.76] Yeah.\n[694.16] Join me.\n[695.92] Not to mention the fact that she's about 130 pounds, so she will be intimidating nobody and she'll be simply um, she'll she'll just be she'll be slapped aside.\n[702.96] Let's be honest, if uh if someone really chooses to.\n[705.68] It turns out though, this is actually just prep for her commercial for the freedom fighter in all of us, home depot, where doers get more done.\n[727.44] Excellent.\n[730.64] It looks like the Netflix version of a breaking bad remake.\n[733.52] Yes, it does.\n[734.00] Yeah.\n[734.32] There's some people get pushed over.\n[735.52] That was an explosion of like blown off the line, like pancaking.\n[739.76] I know, but enough about the celebratory goings on the guys.\n[744.80] She's gotta be this lady has no friends, right?\n[747.44] No.\n[747.92] Well, she's gonna die alone.\n[749.36] And she she seems like she has no, like she's like, go outside, get the gear, go outside.\n[753.36] Like, you're talking to strangers because you don't have any friends.\n[756.64] Well, the good news is that means she's single.\n[760.40] Here we are at my official dating profile request.\n[763.92] I am 42.\n[765.68] I actually am almost 42.\n[767.44] I am a relationship anarchist.\n[769.60] I am on the lookout for somebody who right now will I be able to call and say, hey, get in the passenger seat, and let's go follow some shit up.\n[779.36] Because right now in Minneapolis, what is happening?\n[782.72] Are we are being occupied by ice agents who are of course I couldn't change?\n[788.32] She hates her father.\n[789.84] Who are going door to door?\n[791.36] It's because I'm doing that.\n[792.16] She doesn't have a father.\n[793.20] Um, going door to door and kidnapping people from their homes.\n[796.56] Then you should stay in your home.\n[798.56] Wait for them.\n[799.20] They are going to schools.\n[802.16] Untrue.\n[804.48] They are going to churches.\n[806.00] Nope.\n[806.40] No, that's you.\n[807.68] She should be.\n[808.56] They are going to Target, which I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure.\n[810.88] No, you are one.\n[812.16] No, I'm not targeting.\n[813.52] Right.\n[814.16] Um, so yeah.\n[815.44] If that's you, if you're interested in finding some shit up, if you're not afraid of a woman who can speak her mind, uh, how's that working out in 42?\n[823.20] Sitting in a side seat, message me.\n[826.00] Hard no.\n[828.40] Yeah, if you're a cuck who likes old broads, gimme a call.\n[833.52] We'll have sex once every six months.\n[835.92] Can we be really clear?\n[837.28] No man is afraid of a woman who speaks her mind.\n[841.20] Just to be clear.\n[841.76] This is a whole thing when we're like, well, you know what?\n[843.60] Yeah, it didn't work.\n[844.48] Why didn't it work out?\n[845.44] It didn't work out because I spoke my mind.\n[848.72] No, it didn't work out because you were insufferable.\n[851.28] Because you're delusional.\n[852.48] How do I know you're delusional?\n[854.08] Because you think you're going to take on ice by wearing American gothic gear with both a whistle and gas mask.\n[863.04] Has nothing to do with the fact that you have opinions no one cares about.\n[867.36] You're useless.\n[869.12] Everything to do with the fact that you're preparing for some kind of war that you that doesn't exist.\n[876.16] J just try and explain to anyone throughout all of human history that this white woman in 2026 feels as though she's somehow persecuted.\n[887.28] Or standing up for people who are persecuted who in no way are represented by her.\n[892.16] This is what happens when you have a society that has it so good and a particular subset of people, white suburban women in the United States in 2026.\n[905.28] I don't think there's ever been you guys comment.\n[907.68] Has there ever been a more privileged group that has felt more aggrieved to use a term, which I probably am using improperly because today I can't find my words.\n[918.24] You know what her euphoria is?\n[919.92] Uh a brown or black person telling her thank you.\n[922.80] Yes.\n[923.28] Yeah.\n[923.76] That's euphoria for her.\n[925.04] Oh.\n[925.68] Yeah.\n[926.40] Yes, I deserve that.\n[928.24] Yeah.\n[929.92] You're welcome.\n[931.12] I live to improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n[934.56] Yes.\n[935.12] Because you're not white like me.\n[936.80] I don't do it for the praise, but I know what would you do without me?\n[940.24] The answer is nothing.\n[941.20] So I just, but I do it because it's the right thing to do in my overalls and rape whistle and gas mask.\n[947.28] Which let's be honest, if that's a rape whistle, you're a little ambitious, aren't you, sweetheart?\n[952.40] Well, it's just two.\n[954.64] One is a rape whistle, one is an ice whistle.\n[957.20] Speaking of rape, um, Don Lemon.\n[960.56] So there's been some well, it's you know what I mean.\n[964.96] I just mean that it's a very it's a very degenerate uh uh group of people.\n[968.64] And what do I mean by group of people?\n[970.00] Homosexuals.\n[973.44] I think we'd say orgy as well.\n[976.96] It's very common in this community.\n[978.48] Monogamy doesn't necessarily exist.\n[980.80] Um there's a reason that the the prep pill uh commercials entirely include gay men who very much look like Don Lemon, but he's gonna tell you how to be a good Christian.\n[991.52] So, you know, you have people like uh Thomas Aquinas, you have Martin Luther, um, and now you can include in their ranks noted Christian theologian sodomite, Don Lamon.\n[1011.28] So just to set the stage, it looks like uh Don Lamone might actually catch some charges for what he did because it veered away from journalism into not just activism, but into riots, into uh protests into violating other people's foundational First Amendment rights to practice their religion to freely worship.\n[1030.16] So we'll we'll get into that a little bit.\n[1031.68] I I think he'll probably he'll probably skate on it, but I'm also glad that he's being made an example of.\n[1038.96] Before we get to that, for those of you who missed yesterday, um Don Lemon has very strong views on what Christianity is and was it what it isn't as a noted uh Christian theologian sodomite.\n[1051.20] Jesus Christ, if you believe in if you if that's who you believe in, Jesus Christ.\n[1056.00] Admittedly was not perfect when he was here on this earth.\n[1059.60] So why are we deifying the founders of this country?\n[1062.80] Maybe Joseph was uh, you know, this sort of gay guy who said uh this woman might pick yourself up off the floor.\n[1071.84] Right.\n[1072.24] I don't want to die or be stoned to death or whatever because she is you know, got pregnant and she's not married, and then you know, I am not married and whatever.\n[1081.12] So, okay, this is kind of perfect.\n[1083.12] God is not about hindering people, but not Jesus or even judging people.\n[1086.48] One thing that would really, I believe, change America is if we realize that people that Jesus probably looked more like Cossum than like any of us here, and that we had to get rid of this sort of white surfer guy and really have a a truer depiction of what Jesus is for Christians, and that way I think it would be kind of country altering, if not world altering, because you even had that in the, you know, if you go to Europe, if you go to Italy, you go to the Vatican or whatever, you know, Jesus is like a surfer white guy.\n[1119.36] Uh-huh.\n[1119.84] Uh-huh.\n[1120.56] So the reason that I'm showing this to you is because remember, Don Lemon yesterday, where he was saying, well, I am a Christian.\n[1127.68] And so, and then he tries to tell you how to be a Christian.\n[1129.92] Just remember this.\n[1130.48] Whenever the left tries to tell you, hey, X is unconstitutional, they're lying to you.\n[1134.64] They don't care about constitutionality.\n[1136.16] When they try and tell you, hey, isn't Y uh unchristian of you?\n[1140.08] They're lying to you.\n[1140.80] They're gaslighting you.\n[1141.84] They don't care about the foundational principles, values of our faith of Christianity.\n[1147.12] Because according to Don Lemon, he's a Christian, but Jesus wasn't perfect.\n[1151.76] There was no immaculate conception.\n[1154.00] God will issue no judgment, and he looks like a messed out terrorist.\n[1160.24] Do I have that out, right?\n[1161.52] You forgot that uh Joseph is gay.\n[1164.00] Right.\n[1164.96] You forgot that.\n[1166.08] Yes.\n[1166.64] Okay.\n[1167.28] Yeah.\n[1167.92] Joseph.\n[1169.20] Pretty important.\n[1169.68] Yeah.\n[1170.16] Pretty important fact that Jesus was raised by a gay stepfather.\n[1173.92] Anyone want to sit in the pew at the church of Don Lemon?\n[1177.92] Because he's he's going to let you know that hey, look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks.\n[1180.08] Look, I'm actually a better example of what a Christian is than these people in this church who support deporting illegal aliens.\n[1186.56] Take it from me, noted Christian theologian sodomite Don Lemon, who thinks that Jesus was imperfect, God issues no judgment, and uh Mary was uh a whore with a beard in Joseph.\n[1197.44] Take it from him.\n[1198.48] And if that's not enough for you, just yesterday, after he was making the case that he was a Christian and he was doing this right as a sort of thinly veiled defense against breaking the law.\n[1210.32] He then went on a live stream and did a live ad read for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1217.60] This episode of the Don Lemon Show is brought to you by the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n[1222.72] Equality under the law only works when the government stays neutral.\n[1226.08] The First Amendment wasn't written to protect one religion, it was written to protect all of us.\n[1231.28] And right now that promise is under threat from Christian nationalists who believe their beliefs should control everyone else's beliefs and everyone else's lives.\n[1240.08] Can we also just put this to bed?\n[1241.28] Uh that's that's not true.\n[1243.04] That's not true.\n[1243.76] This idea, like, well, the founders actually wanted to protect all religions equally.\n[1247.36] No, no, the freedom to worship, but you do understand that at that point in time, they probably didn't have a chip in their brain for a religion like Islam getting a foothold here.\n[1256.80] This was largely about the separation of church and state for people who misquote the constitution.\n[1260.48] It's about denominations, right?\n[1262.16] Protection from the church of England that you're you'll be free to practice your largely Protestant denomination in this country.\n[1269.20] If I'm being honest, I think the founding fathers, they probably wouldn't have had a problem with you know things like Buddhism or Baha'i churches, you know, this stuff that doesn't matter.\n[1278.56] They'd be like, so you basically, okay, so you just kind of sit there and you don't believe in heaven or hell, and you do your own.\n[1284.80] It's like kind of like a Quaker.\n[1286.48] All right, whatever.\n[1287.36] No, no, no.\n[1288.32] If they had heard, uh, oh yeah, we're gonna protect uh this is this for Islam, too, right?\n[1292.32] They'd be like, what?\n[1293.52] You mean the pirates?\n[1294.40] No, I said all men are created equal.\n[1296.80] Men.\n[1297.28] Yes.\n[1297.84] Human beings.\n[1298.88] Yeah, wait, hold on a second.\n[1299.84] You're not wait, your religion requires subjecting us.\n[1303.28] You're your your your religion requires subverting our laws.\n[1306.48] You're not trying to start a new political party, are you?\n[1309.28] Uh let's hang them, please.\n[1311.04] That's what they would have done, to be clear.\n[1313.12] And we just act as though all religions are equal.\n[1315.92] Not only as Christians do we not believe that all religions are equal.\n[1319.36] As Christians, you have to believe there's one and only one path to God to salvation, because that's what our faith requires of us.\n[1325.92] But we also don't believe that they're all equal in practice.\n[1329.28] There are religions, there are faiths that are far more corrosive and violent in the real world than others.\n[1335.44] The founding fathers were smart enough to know that.\n[1338.64] This brings us to now.\n[1339.84] Don Lemon claimed that the Minnesota churchgoers, he uh was assisting in uh harassing.\n[1345.52] Well, the real reason for it, and the reason he's in the right is because they were privileged white supremacists.\n[1351.44] And there's a certain degree of entitlement.\n[1353.12] I think people who are, you know, in the religious groups like that, it's not the type of Christianity that I practice, but I think that they're entitled, and that that entire Christian comes from uh a supremacy.\n[1363.52] She looks like a medium who even ghosts don't want to talk about it.\n[1366.80] That it is a Christian country when actually we left England because we wanted religious freedom.\n[1370.96] It's religious freedom, but only if you're a Christian and only if you're a white male, pretty much.\n[1375.36] Yeah, okay.\n[1376.32] Nobody believes that.\n[1377.68] Um, and that lady looks like an inside-out avatar for solitude.\n[1382.16] Everything about her is piercing and cold.\n[1385.44] He is so completely ignorant.\n[1387.36] Yes.\n[1388.16] On every every term.\n[1390.08] At every turn.\n[1390.96] He is completely ignorant.\n[1392.72] I wish I had that confidence, though.\n[1394.00] I wish I had the confidence to say something.\n[1395.60] Yeah.\n[1395.84] So I just say things that are ignorant, and then immediately go, ah, she's like, But there are people like the overall lady that nod and go, hmm, hey.\n[1401.84] It makes sense.\n[1402.48] Yeah.\n[1402.80] Yeah.\n[1403.04] I would I would be willing to bet, since it's St.\n[1405.60] Paul that there were, you know, minority worshippers in that church.\n[1408.48] And I'm pretty sure the viral picture of the mom comforting her child was an Asian woman.\n[1412.96] It definitely was, and it looked like a Middle Eastern, or it looked like a brown woman behind them.\n[1417.68] Yeah, she's back.\n[1419.04] Is she by proxy, or how does this work?\n[1421.36] Well, it's a very good point, though, that he is completely ignorant and and seldom, I mean, outside of Brian Stelter, that's why CNN is just sort of this, it's this marvel sort of spring of of no talent.\n[1432.16] Um thinking of DC.\n[1435.60] Yeah.\n[1436.08] He, I mean, I guess you you you dodge enough HIV bullets and you think you're invincible.\n[1441.36] And he, I guarantee you, I've been around enough of these green rooms.\n[1444.72] As a gay black man, no one would be questioning him in the green room.\n[1449.60] He would espouse something just as dumb as you've just heard, and people go, like, yeah, that's a good point.\n[1453.60] Yeah, you should say that on air, right?\n[1455.28] Because we're all tolerant.\n[1456.56] I would say that too, but I'd be like, Yeah, you should say that.\n[1459.36] Right.\n[1459.60] Yeah, exactly.\n[1460.40] You should say that on national TV.\n[1461.76] He said, Yeah, no, this is good.\n[1462.88] Yeah, Jesus was imperfect, God doesn't judge, and uh Mary was Mary was uh a whore, right?\n[1467.28] And it was like, yes, you are a brave sodomite black man.\n[1470.72] We all we all are, we have your backside.\n[1473.84] I yield my time, Don.\n[1475.04] Go ahead, say that.\n[1476.40] There's a whole lot of dudes with only God can judge me tattoos that are really gonna have to rethink their Yeah.\n[1482.32] We went from only God can judge me to well, God doesn't judge.\n[1485.12] Okay, so I guess there is no judgment whatsoever.\n[1487.76] It's gonna be a rude awakening when uh the gavel comes down and says, guilty.\n[1491.68] Now, Lemon also had a meltdown uh after getting uh, I guess you would say put on blast by none other than Nicki Minaj.\n[1498.48] Nicki Minaj is not a Christian.\n[1499.92] She knows nothing about a Christian, but she is a grip.\n[1502.24] Neither did Nicky Minaj in the pick me.\n[1504.24] And she takes me.\n[1505.28] She's not African American.\n[1506.64] I mean, she's from the islands.\n[1508.08] She is a black woman, but she doesn't understand the African American uh uh struggle, so to speak.\n[1514.32] And if she did, she wouldn't be doing this and saying this on Martin Luther King Day on the Martin Luther King holiday of always putting that out.\n[1523.44] Nicki Minaj doesn't care about black people.\n[1526.64] She doesn't care about gay people.\n[1528.48] Those are two of her quote.\n[1530.24] Yeah, it's got yay.\n[1532.64] And if I was uh as I should say, uh if I I am, as a black and gay person, uh, I'm not supporting her.\n[1540.40] And now she is calling a a gay man a a cocksucker, that's homophobia.\n[1546.48] She is in facts, actually.\n[1548.96] And I choose not to pick her.\n[1552.88] How is that homophobic?\n[1554.40] It sounds like a descriptor.\n[1555.92] Yeah, that's like it's who you are.\n[1558.08] It's your uh dare I say it left.\n[1560.64] It's your identity.\n[1561.84] Right.\n[1562.16] I mean, uh how many times did you say that as a gay man, as a black man?\n[1566.72] So, like you're basically talking about as a cocksucker is what you're saying.\n[1570.56] Like it's these are synonyms.\n[1573.04] How can you be ignorant and inarticulate, be it and it be an anchor man?\n[1577.04] Well, I don't know, but I do like that they have something in common.\n[1579.68] Him and Nicki Minaj.\n[1581.04] Yeah, yeah.\n[1581.60] And I think they both like to suck on the things on the means.\n[1585.04] Yeah.\n[1585.44] Yeah.\n[1585.68] And uh also pick me girl.\n[1587.20] How are you a pick-me-girl when you're married?\n[1589.76] The other thing, too, is that she only cares about who uh made her rich.\n[1593.20] Hey, Don Lamont, let me ask you, who made you rich?\n[1596.08] Uh-huh.\n[1596.72] Was it gay black man?\n[1598.80] Or was it largely, you know, guilty, privileged white women, the people who tune in to say in the daytime.\n[1605.52] Let's be honest.\n[1606.00] This is one thing.\n[1606.40] They'll always apply standards to other people.\n[1608.32] And here's the thing.\n[1608.96] I also understand the argument.\n[1610.32] For example, I was one of the few people when Nala Ray came out, and now she runs a ministry, and you know, I was uh blowing 50 men in an hour uh last week, but now please buy my Bible course.\n[1620.16] I think that people should sit down for a while, uh, sit down in church and learn and should not be in a position of leadership.\n[1626.88] Here's why I will defend Nicki Minaj here.\n[1629.84] And by the way, I I I have no dog in this fight.\n[1632.32] It's not my style of music, but I will say Nicki Minaj did not simply become a gimmick, a Christian.\n[1637.44] She's not a preacher.\n[1638.32] She's not selling a Bible course.\n[1639.92] She still is in the same line of work.\n[1641.60] And Nicki Minaj, by the way, has been a Christian for a long time, meaning she's been on this journey for a while, and if she wants to espouse her opinion, she's not placing herself on an altar.\n[1653.52] It's simply someone who's evolved as a human being over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n[1658.40] Here's a clip of Nicki Minaj in 2015 thanking her pastor after winning a VMA.\n[1662.72] Oh, you know, this is so random.\n[1664.40] You know who I want to thank tonight?\n[1666.72] My pastor.\n[1671.20] What is ridiculous?\n[1674.72] I want to thank my pastor.\n[1676.64] The cameraman.\n[1677.76] Yeah.\n[1678.32] A plus.\n[1680.48] The difference is she's not saying that she is a pastor.\n[1683.12] And I don't think she's an ambassador for Christianity, but she's allowed to espouse her opinion because she's not positioning herself in a role of leadership.\n[1690.24] She's now talking about how she grew up attending church three days a week growing up.\n[1693.92] She's been coming back to the faith.\n[1695.28] So Domin Don Lemon wants to discount that while he engages in daily degeneracy and violates people's First Amendment rights.\n[1703.12] Nikki, to her credit, responded quite quickly, releasing this midnight diss track.\n[1708.16] Yeah.\n[1709.92] Order in the court, please.\n[1711.76] Miss Judge on the mic.\n[1714.56] Bring the choir.\n[1716.24] Amen.\n[1719.36] Don Lemon in the back row, fake fur, tight pants, and a wheat glow.\n[1724.08] Trying to preach, buddy reading from a talk show.\n[1726.48] Fax all wobbly, stunting for the b-row.\n[1729.36] Oh, you ain't Peter, you ain't Paul.\n[1732.32] Those are just the guys who cracked at the mall.\n[1735.12] Right before you pulled up at a church hall.\n[1737.92] Don't blame the Christians.\n[1739.36] And that's the Paul.\n[1740.96] Sunday service family's made a prayer.\n[1743.76] Do you come?\n[1744.72] I'm like on air.\n[1746.08] Turn the pulpit to oppressive vent.\n[1748.80] Had a bailiff taking evidence.\n[1751.44] Don Lemon, why you so bitter?\n[1753.76] Crying like a little bit.\n[1755.36] It's on Twitter.\n[1756.56] Unwatchable like Jennifer Wells, gonna have to start a new show from a cell.\n[1763.12] That one slaps, as the children say.\n[1764.96] Yeah, not bad for some sure notice.\n[1766.88] It's not bad.\n[1768.08] Uh, which brings us to, hey, our charge is coming.\n[1770.64] Uh uh, by the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there, because uh there's no way that this stuff is gonna be airing on YouTube.\n[1779.68] So\n[1770.32] Coming.\n[1771.20] By the way, all signs point to yes, to be clear.\n[1774.00] And the best way to stay in touch, like I've told you, download the rumble app, follow me there because uh there's no way that this stuff is going to be airing on YouTube.\n[1780.08] So after what happened at the church on Sunday in uh Minnesota, um, assistant A.G.\n[1787.52] Harmett Dillon made it pretty clear that the DOJ is uh going to be pursuing, and not just Don Lemon, but the people who organized the storming of the church with uh really the full weight of the law.\n[1799.52] This is gonna get the highest attention from the Department of Justice because there is no more sacred right in our constitution than the right to assemble and pray to God, and there are federal laws that protect that right.\n[1812.32] And what happened here was a shameful exercise of virtue signaling, disruption, fear, terror, and this is illegal.\n[1819.44] And I want to add before people start spazzing about the First Amendment, that the Biden administration prosecuted people peacefully praying outside abortion clinics for much, much less, prosecuted them, prosecuted them under conspiracy statutes under the Klan Act, and which I also have jurisdiction over at the DOJ.\n[1839.92] And so the people who did this made a big big mistake, whoever they are.\n[1844.80] This will be met with the full force of the United States Department of Justice, as the Attorney General has directed.\n[1850.16] And she posted more about that on X.\n[1851.84] And this comes down to hey, okay.\n[1856.40] Their right to peaceably assemble, I know rice.\n[1859.20] They're a Chinese.\n[1860.24] You have the right to rise.\n[1862.00] You can eat all you want.\n[1866.96] This is a house of the roar.\n[1870.72] If you have no rice, it would be a uh point to you.\n[1873.60] Do you see when uh Jesus feed the five thousand ton of two fish in tall five unrise lane?\n[1884.40] I can't surprisingly, I can't do a very good Asian accent.\n[1887.44] They all just turn into an angry Japanese.\n[1889.04] I can't do a good Asian oxon, just uh do good Asian lady.\n[1892.80] Well, you need this more eyes.\n[1899.28] But that's our eyes a holy rice.\n[1911.04] Everybody's coughing.\n[1913.28] Not me.\n[1914.00] It's some plague going around.\n[1915.44] I was choking on rice.\n[1919.60] Korean Jesus is not so happy.\n[1923.20] They're talking about surfer G.\n[1924.48] Don Lam talking about server G, isn't it?\n[1926.16] Didn't mention Korean Jesus.\n[1927.28] No, he doesn't.\n[1927.76] He didn't know with jacked Korean Jesus, but to be fair, no one does.\n[1931.28] Korean Jesus is so stocked.\n[1934.72] He eat all the rice.\n[1944.08] He's a protein rise.\n[1947.68] I was like, yeah, we had that.\n[1948.64] We got our show to do here.\n[1949.60] Yeah, it's true.\n[1950.08] I'm gonna try.\n[1951.12] So why does she say things like spaz out on the first amendment?\n[1954.16] What is that?\n[1954.56] What is that comment?\n[1955.84] I don't know.\n[1956.32] I I honestly being good.\n[1958.48] Didn't she do the Hindi prayer uh for the RNC opening or something?\n[1962.00] She took some flack for that.\n[1963.36] I think Gerald talked to her about hit the RNC.\n[1965.76] He's like, uh, not cool.\n[1967.52] Yeah.\n[1968.08] What did she say?\n[1969.04] She's like, uh, you know, a different story.\n[1971.68] It's like, yeah, but you can see why people wouldn't love us.\n[1976.32] Like Gerald will surprise you where he's like, ah, he's really nice.\n[1978.96] He's like, yeah, I don't like your godless religion.\n[1981.84] And her security removed the large man asking the questions.\n[1985.92] So big must have many rise.\n[1988.88] So um Gerald's racist.\n[1990.96] First off the law.\n[1994.48] That's here to defend himself.\n[1996.24] Uh after I'm doing this accent.\n[2000.64] Some right somewhere right now, you know, Gerald was watching this on his phone.\n[2003.76] He's like, son of a First Amendment.\n[2006.88] Do they have the right to worship?\n[2008.08] Do they have the right to uh practice their religion freely?\n[2010.64] Okay, that's another First Amendment.\n[2011.60] And then Don Lemon goes, Yeah, but First Amendment, I'm a journalist.\n[2014.08] Okay, I understand that.\n[2015.44] I have the right to disrupt and end a church service.\n[2019.76] Now I know what his defense will be.\n[2021.12] His defense will be, well, I was a journalist covering it, I didn't organize it.\n[2024.64] Yeah, but did you become an active participant when you grilled the pastor and you took part in the protest when you knew that they were going in to disrupt people who were peacefully assembled to worship?\n[2038.32] I think a case can be made, but I think that there are a lot of protections for journalists, and so this may be one that they don't make stick, but I hope that they do.\n[2045.44] I don't think you can, I don't think you can tell uh I don't think you told to leave as a journalist and then refuse.\n[2052.96] That's a yeah.\n[2053.68] I don't think private property that that's that exactly what happened.\n[2056.88] He didn't force the pastor to stay there, he wasn't holding him, he was in his face, and he was blocking his you know, two ways of exit, but he did say, and I want you to leave now.\n[2066.24] And then he got closer and asked more questions.\n[2068.56] Yeah.\n[2068.88] No, he refused to leave after being asked to leave a private premises while violating First Amendment right.\n[2074.00] Yeah.\n[2074.24] How does he say he didn't know they were going into a church?\n[2076.08] He's doing B-roll and interviews in front of the church.\n[2078.48] It looks like a church.\n[2079.36] No, no.\n[2080.72] I mean, if you look at it, like some you know how some churches don't look like churches.\n[2083.60] Yeah.\n[2083.92] And it's like, hey, the church of Christ of uh, you know, today's saints or whatever.\n[2088.16] Right.\n[2088.48] And yeah, latter-day earlier days.\n[2090.80] You can tell it's but it looked like one.\n[2092.32] It looked like it was like the hunchback was in there.\n[2095.04] Yeah, exactly.\n[2095.68] He had a camera rolling in front of the church.\n[2097.28] I mean, he was there's that.\n[2098.48] Plus there was also the person that he goes, like, oh, hey, there's the church I'm going to enter.\n[2102.40] There's a stained glass jiffy lube.\n[2104.32] I wonder if there are any sodomites in there.\n[2107.44] They're singing our God is an awesome God.\n[2109.76] Target Richard.\n[2110.56] Who knows what's going on in there?\n[2111.76] Yeah.\n[2112.08] Uh, you know, we'll see.\n[2113.20] It could be anything.\n[2114.16] It could be any.\n[2114.96] By the way, they they're also going to be looking at charges under both the Face Act, like we discussed, and um the Klan Act um or the enforcement act of 1871.\n[2122.40] So faggot.\n[2126.56] Oh no.\n[2128.64] It's coming.\n[2135.84] This on YouTube.\n[2137.12] This show is not off the rails.\n[2138.88] There are no rails.\n[2140.88] This show to me feels like that level in Donkey Kong country when you're on the rail carts and you have to keep jumping.\n[2147.44] Um so what the assistant AG was referring to, and just to be clear, we're pretty consistent as conservatives.\n[2154.48] So when these people were, by the way, they were um arrested or they they were cited because they were obstructing other people going into an abortion clinic.\n[2162.08] I think that's appropriate.\n[2162.96] I think you have the right to protest.\n[2164.00] It's not like England where they arrest you for praying silently outside of an abortion clinic.\n[2168.56] But what really matters here is the comparison.\n[2171.04] Remember, the Biden administration obtained guilty verdicts under these same laws for these people sitting outside an abortion clinic.\n[2178.32] Tell me if it's as disruptive as what you saw yesterday.\n[2192.64] So for going to talk about people saying weaponizing the justice system, those people, guilty verdicts.\n[2199.52] I'm traumatized, actually.\n[2200.80] People who went, yeah, people who went to the church yesterday.\n[2202.72] Singing was pretty screaming at children.\n[2204.64] To be fair, your first amendment right to kill your unborn child does rank slightly above free speech.\n[2208.96] Right.\n[2209.12] Well, that brings us that brings us to the next uh claim, actually, that's been made.\n[2212.80] Um, uh Keith Allison, uh, he said, and this is one of those things where he just says something that's so factually off the beam where I thought, well, maybe maybe hold on a second.\n[2221.84] Maybe I'm misremembering the face act.\n[2224.00] Did I mix it up?\n[2224.80] No, it turns out this guy's full of crap.\n[2226.32] He said that the FACE Act only protects women seeking abortions.\n[2229.20] He said it.\n[2230.00] And the and the Face Act, by the way, is designed to protect the rights of people seeking their reproductive rights um to be protected.\n[2239.92] Uh, and so that people for a religious reason uh, you know, cannot just use religion to break in to women's reproductive health centers.\n[2250.16] Right.\n[2250.80] So how they are stretching either of these laws to apply to people who protested in a church over the behavior or the perceived behavior of a of a religious leader is is beyond me.\n[2263.76] I think he's thinking of the uh face your creator for judgment act.\n[2268.48] Yeah, he could be.\n[2269.36] He's a little bit.\n[2270.56] Face yourself in the mirror and not cry act.\n[2272.88] And that's something, by the way, that we just sort of skim over.\n[2275.52] Uh if we believe that every life is fearfully wonderfully created, and we understand that the science says that DNA is unique, it's not the mother's DNA, it's not the father's DNA.\n[2283.92] And we also understand that there's 10 to 15,000 late-term abortions going on every year.\n[2289.12] That's a scary thought that those women are going to have to face their creator and account for that.\n[2295.76] We kind of just gloss over that.\n[2298.00] There's a comedian out there who I can't remember who it was, but they said, Do you think that uh somebody who has a if they had multiple abortions, you'd think they go to heaven and all those babies are waiting for them?\n[2307.20] Those babies are definitely there.\n[2308.40] I don't know.\n[2308.96] The mom might have to greet them from afar as she hits the down button on the escalator.\n[2313.60] Yeah, she does he felt he's just a regular dude, though.\n[2316.64] He wouldn't, why would he know the law?\n[2318.16] It's not like he's the attorney general of the state.\n[2320.24] Right.\n[2320.56] That's what's so scary.\n[2321.60] Because here's the truth.\n[2322.64] Um the face act explicitly mentions religion, houses of worship.\n[2329.04] Let me let me read this for you.\n[2330.56] The uh face act uh makes it pretty clear that prosecutors can criminally charge anyone who, quote, by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intimidates or interferes with any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\n[2351.44] How did Elison get that wrong?\n[2353.12] Well, here's the thing.\n[2354.40] You either have to believe that he is quite literally functionally retarded, or he's lying to you.\n[2361.04] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.48] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that plant parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.40] He could, yeah, worshiping at\n[2361.28] And by the way, I'm leading the witness.\n[2362.96] Of course he's lying to you.\n[2364.56] There's also a third option.\n[2365.44] He thinks that Plant Parenthood is a place of worship.\n[2367.76] It's true.\n[2368.48] He could.\n[2368.96] Yeah.\n[2369.36] Worshiping at the altar of boards.\n[2371.12] Yeah, boy.\n[2372.16] Yes.\n[2373.20] And the KKK Act or the Clan Act, some people refer uh to it, uh, by the way, that can actually be used whenever someone conspires to violate people's civil rights.\n[2380.40] You can invoke that act, right?\n[2382.32] Specifically because the KKK would do that.\n[2384.00] They would intimidate people into silence.\n[2385.60] They would uh harm people, kill people if they were protesting.\n[2389.44] So that's why it exists.\n[2391.36] It also provides for civil monetary damages to victims.\n[2394.80] So Don Lemon might have to face that.\n[2396.80] And so really now what's actually pretty interesting is Kalchi, they have their odds up right now.\n[2400.80] Who's going to be charged with a federal crime in 2026?\n[2403.04] Did you guys can you guys bring this up?\n[2404.32] Don Lemon now is at 72%.\n[2407.60] Oh my god.\n[2408.16] 72%.\n[2408.80] Letitia James at 53%.\n[2410.40] Wow.\n[2410.72] Comey at 50, Ilon Omar at 47%.\n[2414.24] Think about that for a second.\n[2415.52] That's fun to watch.\n[2417.12] Yeah.\n[2417.60] Do I think that it'll stick?\n[2419.04] I don't know.\n[2419.76] He might walk because he's a journalist and he might get a slap on the wrist.\n[2422.48] But is there a parlay for that?\n[2424.56] I I don't even know how the betting works.\n[2426.64] All four of them.\n[2427.52] But I do think Don Lemon better put on his.\n[2430.96] I mean, he better put on his shitting pants because he's about to be shitting himself.\n[2435.92] Use the KKK acting put in the win and putundam in the way.\n[2440.88] Just put him away.\n[2451.28] All right, that's all I have on that.\n[2454.88] All right.\n[2455.44] Ben Shapiro and Lane the Brand, I know we were working on this.\n[2457.68] And you know, we always want to try and be uh tactful in approaching this because I think Ben Shapiro is right about a lot.\n[2463.84] And I think he's uh been wrong about an increasing amount as of late.\n[2469.92] Um and right now, when there's a civil sort of, I don't even want to say civil war, but there are these fractions on the right and and and there's sort of these clicks being created.\n[2479.20] You have one side saying, hey, it's really important to be consistent about our principles, and I agree.\n[2483.44] Ben Shapiro often toes that line.\n[2486.24] Uh, I think he believes it, but he will pull a sleight of hand.\n[2490.08] And I don't think that his argument here on Gavin Newsom's podcast uh was in good faith regarding housing prices.\n[2498.16] First off, let me ask you this.\n[2501.44] When we talk about the housing crisis in this country, what do you think?\n[2508.32] Okay.\n[2509.04] My next question is when President Trump is saying that there will be legislation that will bar institutional investors from purchasing single family uh homes in this country.\n[2520.80] What do you think that's meant to address?\n[2525.84] I know what your answer is.\n[2527.60] Ben Shapiro on Gavin Newsom's podcast said, you're talking about rent prices, right?\n[2532.96] I don't think that that's being particularly straightforward or honest.\n[2537.28] And that's why when we've addressed this, uh, I offered a six-point prescription on how I genuinely believe we could lower housing prices in this country.\n[2546.16] Here's a refresher.\n[2547.20] So let me walk you back through it.\n[2548.64] Six-point plan, okay, just to make sure there's no misinterpretation, ban of purchases from institutional investors or foreign investors on single family home units.\n[2559.60] Only citizens, local permanent residents, can buy homes with very strict verification, severe penalties for anyone housing renting to or selling homes to illegal aliens along with increased deportations, an immigrant legal immigrant renting period for the first two years of residency, incentivize starter homes on the builder's side with tax breaks, tax credits, and then incentivize first-time home buyers with a tax deduction for that first year.\n[2584.64] And I think this is important where we'll often discuss what conservatism, what uh uh, you know, put America first means.\n[2592.80] I certainly think that that means the government uh should act in the best interests of its people, provided they are not violating any fundamental constitutional rights.\n[2603.60] And when you take into account that in 1991, for example, the median age for first-time homebuyers was 28 years old, now it's 38 years old.\n[2609.76] Some of that includes personal responsibility, yes.\n[2613.12] Some of it includes some failures at an institutional level.\n[2617.76] Conservatives, conservatism is of no value if it's not actually addressing those problems.\n[2625.68] So now we find ourselves at a point where the population of renters is growing at a rate like three times faster than homeowners.\n[2632.16] Is that good for the country?\n[2633.60] And then you have to ask yourself is it good for the country when there are people who are here illegally who have no business being in this country are homeowners in the place of young working Americans.\n[2644.00] That brings us to Ben Shapiro talking with Gavin Newsom.\n[2647.52] Uh making this claim when the jumping off point was Donald Trump's policy on institutional investors purchasing up single family unit homes.\n[2658.40] Okay, the fact is that in the state of California, for example, exorbitantly low percentage of the city.\n[2663.60] Relative to other states.\n[2664.56] Yeah, very relative to those states for sure.\n[2666.32] Yeah.\n[2666.48] Okay, and guess what?\n[2667.36] Real estate here, really, really expensive.\n[2669.28] And meanwhile, if you go over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the real estate prices actually have been diving, you actually do have pretty significant corporate ownership.\n[2676.24] And here we're talking about large corporations, not like small mom and pop operations where you own a second home to rent it out.\n[2681.12] Typically speaking, when a corporation invests in an area like say Phoenix and then builds up an enormous number of rental units, because that's what happens.\n[2688.72] They buy, let's say, a single family home, now they rent it out.\n[2690.96] Okay, so they just increased the stock of rent.\n[2693.76] Right, which means that the rental prices go down.\n[2696.08] And then corporations typically are investing in areas where it's easier to buy and easier to renovate and easier to build.\n[2702.16] Like renovating is very difficult in places like New York and in certain parts of California.\n[2705.68] It's a lot easier in say Austin or Phoenix or Florida.\n[2708.56] And so what you've seen is actually there is not only zero correlation between corporate ownership of real estate assets and price of rent, for example.\n[2717.52] In many cases, there's a reverse correlation.\n[2719.60] And so trying to refocus on look at this terrible it isn't black rock.\n[2724.32] Black rap doesn't own real estate assets in this fashion.\n[2726.88] Um it's Black Stone's fault that the real estate prices are going up.\n[2733.04] No, it isn't.\n[2733.92] And again, yeah, I think that that's So what's what's why is he pursuing two policies that you vehemently disagree with?\n[2739.84] Because I think that it's flailing on the issue of the economy with the American people.\n[2750.08] Now, do you see what Ben Shapiro just did there?\n[2753.68] Everything that he said is factually true.\n[2757.44] And so he made the case for Donald Trump's policy if you want more first-time home buyers.\n[2765.52] Everything he said is technically true, and he seems to think that the solution is more available units for rent.\n[2774.24] That's not the issue.\n[2775.68] That's not the crisis that we're addressing.\n[2777.76] And by the way, yes, part of this crisis has been created by the government.\n[2780.96] It would be like someone taking you out on a boat, you falling off the boat, drowning, and then throwing you a motorcycle when you need a life preserver.\n[2790.72] Yeah, the housing market was screwed up.\n[2792.32] We can go back to the subprime loans.\n[2793.92] We know all about that.\n[2794.80] But at this point in time, people are not able to buy homes.\n[2798.16] People aren't complaining about not being able to rent.\n[2800.40] As a matter of fact, in the absence of home ownership to build equity in a nest egg, people are forced to rent.\n[2805.60] And Ben Shapiro's going, well, see, now that isn't it good.\n[2808.32] Institutional investors make it so you're more likely to have to rent.\n[2813.84] Yeah.\n[2814.64] Yeah, I don't know if you saw a slight hand.\n[2816.32] He starts by referring to these as real estate prices.\n[2818.88] He's like, real estate's cheaper, real estate, and then slides in calling it rent.\n[2822.64] Rent.\n[2823.12] Hoping that you don't notice he avoided the actual elephant in the room, which is home buying.\n[2828.08] He also slighted when he said single family homes, and then and and then they start building these rental units.\n[2833.28] Yeah.\n[2833.60] It's like, well, well, we I think we all understand single family home as a standalone house.\n[2838.96] Yeah.\n[2839.68] That one family lives in.\n[2840.88] We don't no one thinks single family single family single family home and thinks an apartment.\n[2844.80] And this is also why, by the way, Ben Shapiro has been invited on the show, and I think he's uh pretty respectful, and I think we could have a good conversation.\n[2851.44] But when people say, can't believe that you would platform insert X person here.\n[2854.88] Let's say Nick Fuentes.\n[2855.92] I go, well, well, he's he's he's sitting next to Gavin Newsom.\n[2859.44] Does anyone want to make the case that Nick Fuentes is more dangerous and more corrosive to the American fabric than that guy running for president who wanted to trans kids and accuse you of hate speech if you spoke out against it?\n[2869.84] That's why I'm not gonna play that game.\n[2871.92] And here's the truth.\n[2873.52] And please check the references.\n[2875.28] Uh yes, rents are down.\n[2877.92] Purchase prices are way up.\n[2880.24] So he used Charlotte and Phoenix as examples.\n[2882.88] Let me give you, yeah, rent prices.\n[2884.64] Uh Charlotte, they're down about 1.4%.\n[2887.04] Phoenix, they're down about 4%.\n[2888.72] This is just year over year.\n[2889.84] Okay.\n[2890.32] By the way, the national average for rent is down 1.1% year over year.\n[2894.80] So it's not like their particular standouts and making things more affordable for people.\n[2899.12] Let's contrast that with the problem that the policy is meant to address.\n[2902.96] And the problem that you care about, check the references.\n[2906.00] Home prices are up astronomically.\n[2909.60] So if you look at Charlotte from 2015 to 2025, 173,000, average price for a home to 410,000, more than double.\n[2918.00] Jeez.\n[2918.64] Phoenix, 215,000.\n[2920.72] Sorry, two uh in 2015, 213,000.\n[2923.60] 2025, 514,000.\n[2926.88] So your rent's gone down a percentage point or two.\n[2930.00] The prices of homes have doubled.\n[2933.92] This approach to conservatism, therefore, that's a good thing, and we want bigger institutional investors.\n[2941.76] It's not the right-wing extremism that would be the reason for losing midterms or the next national election.\n[2947.52] I would argue it's this approach.\n[2950.40] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is\n[2950.48] I would argue that anyone making the case for large institutional investors because it's easier for you to rent, even though purchasing a home is further from reach than ever before.\n[2963.76] I don't think that that's actually something.\n[2965.84] Not only do I think optically, not only do I think that it won't resonate.\n[2970.16] I actually think it's immoral.\n[2972.16] Because that's not the that's not the result of the free market, to be clear.\n[2976.72] It it really isn't.\n[2977.68] These institutional investors, we heard from Elizabeth Warren, they're too big to fail.\n[2981.36] So they're gambling with your money.\n[2983.04] What do you think is going to happen if there's a crash?\n[2985.04] You think they're gonna be left or holding the bag?\n[2987.28] No, of course not.\n[2988.00] You will.\n[2988.88] So on the front end, you're not able to purchase a home.\n[2991.28] You're priced out because of these people.\n[2993.36] And on the tail end, well, you're gonna be subsidizing them in the form of a bailout.\n[2996.56] That's inevitable.\n[2997.28] That will happen.\n[3000.08] I I don't understand it.\n[3002.08] Maybe someone can present this case, man.\n[3003.52] I don't know if this is a someone thinks that it's a Milton Friedman free market argument.\n[3006.72] Like, yeah, yeah, no, no, actually, conservatism should really support the institutional investors, pricing people out of their neighborhoods so that we can create a permanent class of renters.\n[3014.88] I can only imagine making this case if you think it's beneficial to the American fabric at large to have a permanent class of renters.\n[3024.40] And here's another truth.\n[3025.60] He points to Charlotte in Phoenix.\n[3027.84] Well, he's right.\n[3028.56] Institutional investors own a disproportionate share of single family homes in those areas.\n[3033.36] So, like in the national average, institutional investors owning these single family homes is like one, two percent.\n[3038.00] In Charlotte, it's eighteen percent.\n[3040.48] In Phoenix, it's ten percent.\n[3044.32] So, more institutional investors.\n[3046.40] Ben Shapiro says, that's good.\n[3048.80] That's why I am against Donald Trump's policy, because rent is cheaper.\n[3053.68] I go, okay, more institutional investors.\n[3055.92] Rent is slightly cheaper, and home prices are astronomically inflated.\n[3064.32] What bothers me is when you have people from that side of the conservative aisle saying that we're abandoning our principles, our free market principles, if we're saying, oh, this is a manipulated market.\n[3075.44] And it's a manipulated market to benefit institutional investors, by the way, who are not beholden to the American people at all, but international coalitions often at the cost of Americans.\n[3086.32] How is that looking out for our people?\n[3088.08] Important to note that Charlotte and Phoenix are both uh cities with high populations of uh migrant influx.\n[3095.52] That's true as well.\n[3096.64] Both very high, one from Latin America, one from uh overseas.\n[3101.36] Which is why part of my uh multipoint plan is you cannot purchase a home if you are here illegally.\n[3105.52] As a matter of fact, you're not allowed to stay in a home if you are here illegally.\n[3108.56] That should go to an American homeowner.\n[3111.44] What why do you think Ben is and I have a theory on this, but it's such a it seems like he has such a worship of free markets that he's blind to the realities that those free markets cause.\n[3121.68] Like he'll say free trade is good.\n[3124.24] Yeah, in theory, until it you know deindustrializes America and we can no longer make anything.\n[3128.80] Right.\n[3129.12] The Browning of America, I don't care about it.\n[3131.36] Okay, yes, until you completely lose your culture on the thing that made America possible in the first place.\n[3135.60] Because it's uh it's a weird wing of the conservatives here that just blankly worships the free market.\n[3140.24] Yeah.\n[3140.64] As though it is some benevolent being.\n[3143.84] It's a very strange phenomenon that really needs to be dealt with.\n[3146.48] It definitely needs to be dealt with.\n[3147.52] And the free market, when we generally think of it, especially when you go back to, you know, like someone like Adam Smith and the invisible hand that determines markets, right?\n[3152.96] Supply and demand.\n[3154.00] Ultimately that is predicated around the idea of a goods or service creator, provider, and a consumer.\n[3162.56] When you add uh international speculative markets where people are actually looking to squeeze out profit that does not benefit the consumer, we now have a different motive than creating the best product in a competitive market for consumers who can vote with their dollar.\n[3178.40] And then when you add more complications to it, for example, like the housing market, where banks are forced to take on risk, as we've seen for a very long time to people who had no business being in those homes who would never be able to pay it back.\n[3189.04] But hey, that money's insured by you, the taxpayer.\n[3191.28] Now we've added to the problem.\n[3193.28] And now we have institutional investors buying up homes when they have no connection to your community whatsoever.\n[3198.88] This is not good for America.\n[3200.88] It's not good for people in these communities, and I don't know how any conservative can argue for it.\n[3205.60] Here's some more proof for you.\n[3207.28] Median home prices, by the way, in both of those places, they are continuing to skyrocket.\n[3212.40] So let me give you some context here.\n[3214.48] Uh yes, you can purchase a home, and we've talked about this.\n[3217.44] You can make some decisions where you can cut some costs and you can purchase a home a little further out of the city, and a first-time home is within reach for many people, especially if you compare it to previous generations, the amenities, the size.\n[3228.96] Still, we do need to address the fact that in Charlotte, for example, the median income is 78,000.\n[3234.56] In 2005, the median income that would be required to buy the average first-time home would be about 32,000.\n[3241.76] In 2020, it'd be about 50,000.\n[3243.52] 2025, 91,000.\n[3245.84] This outpaces the inflation of wages, to be clear.\n[3249.28] Phoenix, the median income is 77,000 right now.\n[3252.16] 2005, what will be needed to purchase that home will be about 50,000 dollars.\n[3255.12] 2020, 71,000.\n[3256.64] From 2020 to 2025, 122,000 would need to be the median income to match up with the average home in the Phoenix area.\n[3269.92] I don't think we're going to get anywhere by saying, uh, you know what, these populists, they actually don't have a point.\n[3275.36] And you also need to look at that acceleration.\n[3277.52] How is that free market where you see a graph that goes up and then spikes up because of an artificially engineered, manipulated, picking winners and losers market post-COVID.\n[3291.52] In 15 years, that median income required went up about 21,000.\n[3297.60] In five years, it doubled.\n[3301.44] It's incredible.\n[3302.72] And then in places like Charlotte, if you look at the new home, there's like 20, a lot of new homes built.\n[3307.44] The ones that would be defined as starter level homes was like 1.1% of all new homes built.\n[3313.12] Yeah.\n[3313.68] So that's the free market saying that's what we can make money on, but how is that actually serving the community at all?\n[3318.72] No, exactly right.\n[3319.76] And I see some free market.\n[3321.28] Look at Mundami and and and uh Newsom and what they've done in their environments.\n[3326.40] You make them less desirable.\n[3328.40] And you're gonna drive prices down.\n[3329.68] For sale signs everywhere in Manhattan now.\n[3331.84] People are getting out of dodge.\n[3333.12] They're getting out for their 181 days or six months a year to avoid taxes, and now they're just moving out entirely.\n[3338.64] Yeah, but you know who buys that, it's international speculators that come in and like, well, New York will be good again.\n[3343.20] I'll pay exorbitant prices for these right now because it'll go up in the future.\n[3346.32] And then you compound that by the fact that Mamdani wants to raise property taxes right now while instituting rent freezes.\n[3351.44] Well, let me ask you this.\n[3352.40] What do you think happens there?\n[3354.56] You're someone who owns properties.\n[3356.48] Let's say you own five.\n[3358.08] Three now are facing uh rent control, rent freezes.\n[3361.60] Your property taxes go up.\n[3363.20] What do you think happens to the cost of those remaining two properties that are not rent controlled?\n[3368.88] So this is how the left, yeah, they benefit those who don't contribute, those who are in subsidized housing, those who lock down an apartment and they're fine living with rats.\n[3375.60] But if you're working hard and you want to pay for a semi-decent apartment, guess what?\n[3379.12] That's completely out of reach as the result of these policies to correct women's privilege.\n[3383.36] Rent control or rent freeze anyway.\n[3384.88] Yeah.\n[3385.60] That's basically what it is.\n[3386.40] I know what happens.\n[3387.20] Uh they get desperate.\n[3388.72] The owners of the properties get desperate, and they sell for a super low price to who?\n[3392.80] The city.\n[3393.28] Yes.\n[3393.76] The city uses that.\n[3395.04] They make it to be uh low-income housing or government funded housing.\n[3399.36] That's how they do it.\n[3400.24] Yep.\n[3400.64] That's how they turn New York City into a commie state.\n[3402.88] Yeah.\n[3403.12] And by the way, if you have the income of the median panhandler, you still can snag this beauty in Gary, Indiana.\n[3431.36] So uh institutional investment uh may result in cheaper rent, though.\n[3435.68] It's really just part of a national trend right now overall.\n[3438.48] Uh it uh seems to have to use his word, seems to have an inverse correlation with reducing the costs of homes.\n[3444.80] And if Ben Shapiro would like to come on and make the case on home prices for people to purchase, I'd like to have that discussion.\n[3452.96] I know he was uh going to come on a while back, and uh I don't know what happened, I guess it fell through.\n[3457.76] He's still welcome to, and of course, we'll keep the tone respectful.\n[3460.88] Uh a place uh for which I have uh decreasing respect, Greenland.\n[3468.88] And what do I mean by that?\n[3470.64] Um I mean the country, I mean how it's run, I mean the people, I mean in general.\n[3474.96] Uh which I know uh it will not go over well with the uh 55,000 people of Greenland, but it is such an insignificant market share that I will be honest, uh Greenlanders, I don't take it into account.\n[3487.60] They have less people in their country than are watching this show right now.\n[3490.88] Yes.\n[3491.28] That's exactly right.\n[3492.56] Well, there's probably a little overlap.\n[3493.92] There's probably some Greenlanders.\n[3495.44] There are probably a couple someone right there having their breakfast of reconstituted fish fat soup in the coldest climate on earth.\n[3504.72] Trying to eat my fish head soup.\n[3506.72] Lacking vitamin D, lighting their lamp with whale oil.\n[3510.40] Okay.\n[3511.20] I'm sorry, Greenland, you've been through enough, but we're gonna put you through more.\n[3514.48] So before we get into um the ins and outs of Greenland, I think a lot of people may not be familiar with the history there, which is why they always try and paint the United States as uh for some reason unique in wanting to position ourselves as best as possible globally.\n[3528.32] Here's some memes that uh President Trump dropped last night on Truth Social.\n[3533.68] Okay.\n[3534.40] And then at 1 a.m., look at that right there.\n[3536.88] I'm gonna do it.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.24] It really is.\n[3543.20] Uh now the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is.\n[3540.88] What a timeline.\n[3542.16] It really is.\n[3543.52] Now, the media, and of course, leftists that have you believe that the United States is this imperialist nation and that this is uh something that is unique to us at this point in time.\n[3552.16] That's the playbook.\n[3553.44] The the politician, what's her n uh, what's the politician's name from Greenland?\n[3556.32] Um Tilly Tilly.\n[3558.64] Mart Martin Nocies?\n[3560.16] I guess so.\n[3560.88] Well, this person is going viral for the first time in the history of ever on social media for her comments about the United States, like we care.\n[3568.80] The rich like the American Sarah, see how greedy they are.\n[3571.68] They're even trying to shoot their friends or invade their friends uh just for greed.\n[3577.20] And we know that there's minerals and oils possibly in our underground.\n[3581.68] And that's worth so much more even than that.\n[3584.24] But even if we didn't have that, we would still not.\n[3586.88] Eskimo with lip fillers.\n[3588.56] So um everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska and all of the native tribes, uh, Indians, American Indians who are there.\n[3596.64] Um, their land was taken from them, and they haven't been treated that well in casinos.\n[3602.08] We know that uh Trump is very much uh surrounding himself, at least with uh uh white powered people, and we are not white, as you can see.\n[3610.24] Like Marco Ruby are uh of color.\n[3612.56] And so we know this probably would be taken away.\n[3615.92] So a couple of things there.\n[3616.88] Did she just say that the uh Alaskan natives that America took their land from them?\n[3620.64] Is that what she said?\n[3621.36] She's the natives in the world.\n[3622.80] Yeah, the natives.\n[3623.52] She's aware that the that a l like it was a land purchase from Russia, right?\n[3628.24] You guys want to take your chance with the Russians?\n[3630.72] Yeah, and what which other properties are you is she talking about?\n[3634.40] Is she talking about California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas?\n[3637.84] This is one of those things where they act like we're uniquely responsible.\n[3641.12] This goes back to this whole trope about us taking the land from Native Americans, while completely ignoring that Native American tribes were taking them from other tribes in usually far more barbaric and cruel ways.\n[3650.08] Also, they try and paint this picture like Greenland is this peaceful country.\n[3653.04] Like we have this wonderful way of life that the United States wants to wants to come in and disrupt.\n[3657.52] Um the suicide rate in Greenland is through the roof.\n[3661.76] It's 81 per 100,000.\n[3664.48] Like Japan would dream of that, to be clear.\n[3667.76] And that's the land of tiny plummeting bodies and suicide forests.\n[3673.92] What is uh do we know ours?\n[3675.76] Well, in Alaska, to give you an idea, because we wanted to compare apples to apples, you know, a tundra wasteland.\n[3680.16] It's 27 per 100,000.\n[3682.08] It's not even close.\n[3683.12] That's our worst state, too.\n[3684.48] That's our worst state.\n[3685.76] So that's Eskimo to Eskimo comparison right there.\n[3688.56] That's we say we say Inuit.\n[3690.56] Oh, we say Inuit?\n[3691.84] Not in this studio.\n[3692.72] Japan's about 16.\n[3694.08] I'm about to go visit the Winuit casino.\n[3697.28] Think think about that for a second.\n[3698.64] It's just worse.\n[3699.28] Hey, it's not working well, Greenland.\n[3702.00] Why?\n[3702.72] Because you're all killing yourselves.\n[3705.60] Like, your suicide rate, you're the trannies of the uh Alaskan tundra.\n[3711.68] But we don't want them to be.\n[3713.04] We want them to be Americans.\n[3714.48] Yes.\n[3714.88] We uh, you know.\n[3716.40] There's a better way.\n[3717.84] Do we?\n[3718.40] Yeah, do we want them to be American?\n[3721.44] Well, Puerto Rico.\n[3723.36] Kind of.\n[3724.16] You want them to be American?\n[3725.20] I don't want them to be.\n[3725.92] No, I want them to be like Puerto Rico.\n[3727.84] Alberta, maybe.\n[3728.80] But I I will say this.\n[3730.40] Um you guys know how how how Denmark uh came to be sort of in charge of Greenland.\n[3738.88] Like, has anyone gone through this history?\n[3740.72] We're just gonna ignore all of that.\n[3742.08] I don't know if you know this, but like the the Danes, they they don't look like the Eskimos of Greenland.\n[3747.76] There were there was a period of time where there was a change.\n[3750.48] Did you know that?\n[3751.20] Yeah.\n[3751.52] Well, let me bring you back to the year 985, right?\n[3754.96] Uh, this is Eric the Red.\n[3756.40] You're familiar?\n[3757.20] Yeah.\n[3757.68] Greenland was discovered, colonized by Nor this Norse Viking Eric the Red.\n[3762.48] You're probably quite familiar with them.\n[3764.64] And just because there wasn't like a ton of bloody battles or war, that's just because there were so few people they didn't even know that he was there yet.\n[3773.84] And he the the Nordics pretty much just said, like, you know that you're ours now.\n[3780.48] And they were like, all right.\n[3781.68] And to be fair, if he came across them, it probably didn't go well because his dad got kicked out of Norway for killing somebody, and then he got kicked out of Iceland for killing multiple people.\n[3789.76] Right.\n[3790.08] So not a super good guy.\n[3791.60] Yeah, it wasn't like they were coming in peace, to be clear.\n[3794.24] Then there was the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, where um this was during the kind of uh the Napoleonic Wars.\n[3800.16] Uh Denmark agreed to sort of cede Norway to Sweden.\n[3803.60] And I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[3805.12] I am not a historian on this because uh it's pretty much all the same to me.\n[3810.32] Uh, that area of the world.\n[3812.48] It's it's it's very homogenous, and I understand there's a difference between Nordic and Scandinavian, and I get that the Swedes would be really mad if you compared them to the Norwegians, but you you know what the point is, we really don't care.\n[3821.60] Hey, we're not all the same.\n[3822.96] Yeah, we're not we're not the same.\n[3824.16] We're the ones we do, we do dinner pancakes and they eat fish soup.\n[3828.40] Whatever.\n[3829.44] Who cares, dude?\n[3831.36] We need it for a matter of national security.\n[3833.52] So Denmark.\n[3834.72] Is this big?\n[3835.44] Yeah, they they retained control of Greenland, which was a Norwegian territory.\n[3839.68] And let's go through actually this idea that the United States would be far worse uh as far as rulers of Greenland.\n[3847.20] And I know that this sort of comes from this idea that socialism is by default good uh because they get free health care, you know, they get uh paid paternity, maternity leave for eight years or whatever the hell it is in these uh Scandinavian countries.\n[3858.80] So they think like, yeah, these people actually want these social safety benefits.\n[3861.84] It's this big.\n[3862.56] And they've been treated well by Denmark.\n[3865.12] Um it's actually a really awful history.\n[3869.84] I know you don't often think when you think of colonizers, you may think of the British, you may think of the French, you may think of the Portuguese, the Spanish, some cases actually the the Belgians were really bad.\n[3879.36] Uh you may want to look into the history of Denmark and Greenland a little bit before you start shouting foul at the United States.\n[3886.40] And by the way, we're gonna continue with this.\n[3887.60] We have some more clips, we have some more facts here on the history of Greenland, but you do have to join Rumble Premium, click that button right there below.\n[3893.44] 99 dollars a year or 99 a month, you get everything ad-free, 100% more show, all the content that you see.\n[3899.12] This brings me to key fact number two in the 1950s, Denmark forcibly removed 20 children from their homes in Greenland.\n[3906.88] And I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but that's like 30% of their population.\n[3911.36] And the goal was to sort of foster an elite to govern Greenland.\n[3916.24] It didn't work.\n[3916.80] In the 1950s and 1960s, the Danish government forcibly relocated coastal Greenlanders into cities.\n[3923.92] This was aimed at consolidating the population.\n[3926.72] Ah, they ghettoized them.\n[3927.92] Yes.\n[3928.24] Yes, 15 minute cities.\n[3930.40] Which by the way, if you know about like the worst group of people to ghetto eyes are Eskimos.\n[3935.60] I didn't know that.\n[3936.56] They don't do very well in large cities because uh they're technologically uh very, very rudimentary and they're drunks.\n[3944.48] Only two to an igloo.\n[3947.60] Keep your hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.\n[3950.24] Keep both feet on the ground.\n[3952.48] Uh 19.\n[3954.24] That's a dad with dating teenage Eskimo daughter.\n[3958.16] Okay.\n[3959.12] No Eskimo kisses till your married nose is at opposite ends of the room.\n[3964.08] And here's something else.\n[3965.04] In the 1960s, while they were relocating people, they were ghettoizing them, Danish doctors forcibly sterilized more than 4500 Greenlandic women.\n[3973.76] Henrietta Bertelson was forced to learn Danish in school.\n[3977.12] This is real to submit to Danish doctors.\n[3980.08] One of them did something to her that haunts her to this day.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

The video clip is precisely aligned with the transcript below:\n- The video starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The transcript starts at 0.00 seconds\n- Both are synchronized in the same normalized time coordinate system\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the video frames to visually identify the exact moment boundaries. Look for:\n- Visual cues that indicate the start of the topic/segment\n- Scene changes, speaker changes, or visual transitions\n- The exact frame where the engaging content begins and ends\n- Correlation between what you see and what you hear in the transcript\n\nAnalyze BOTH the video frames and the word-level transcript to determine the most accurate timestamps. The timestamps you output should match this normalized coordinate system (starting from 0.00).\n\nTASK CONTEXT:\nYou are refining the timestamps for an existing video moment. The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Introduction to the show and key topics including Greenland and Don Lemon\"\n- Current start time: 10.96 seconds\n- Current end time: 70.96 seconds\n\nIMPORTANT - COORDINATE SYSTEM:\nAll timestamps (transcript, video, and the current moment times above) are in the SAME normalized coordinate system:\n- The clip starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The clip ends at 105.36 seconds\n- Both the transcript and video are aligned to this coordinate system\n- Your output timestamps must also be in this coordinate system (0.00 to 105.36)\n\nThe current timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps. Each line shows:\n- The start and end time of a specific word in seconds (starting from 0.00)\n- The word itself\n\nFormat: [start_time-end_time] word\n\nExample:\n[5.12-5.48] rather\n[5.48-5.76]

No wrapper array. No other fields. Just { ... }.\n\n\n\nVIDEO INPUT:\nA video clip is provided along with this request. The video clip is precisely aligned with the transcript below:\n- The video starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The transcript starts at 0.00 seconds\n- Both are synchronized in the same normalized time coordinate system\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the video frames to visually identify the exact moment boundaries. Look for:\n- Visual cues that indicate the start of the topic/segment\n- Scene changes, speaker changes, or visual transitions\n- The exact frame where the engaging content begins and ends\n- Correlation between what you see and what you hear in the transcript\n\nAnalyze BOTH the video frames and the word-level transcript to determine the most accurate timestamps. The timestamps you output should match this normalized coordinate system (starting from 0.00).\n\nTASK CONTEXT:\nYou are refining the timestamps for an existing video moment. The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Don Lemon's church disruption and potential federal charges\"\n- Current start time: 29.36 seconds\n- Current end time: 149.36 seconds\n\nIMPORTANT - COORDINATE SYSTEM:\nAll timestamps (transcript, video, and the current moment times above) are in the SAME normalized coordinate system:\n- The clip starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The clip ends at 179.36 seconds\n- Both the transcript and video are aligned to this coordinate system\n- Your output timestamps must also be in this coordinate system (0.00 to 179.36)\n\nThe current timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps. Each line shows:\n- The start and end time of a specific word in seconds (starting from 0.00)\n- The word itself\n\nFormat: [start_time-end_time] word\n\nExample:\n[5.12-5.48] rather\n[5.48-5.76] than\n[5.76-5.92] be\n[5.92-6.24] scared\n\nThe first word in the transcript starts at or near 0.00 seconds.\n\nWord-level transcript:\n[0.00-0.32] is\n[0.64-0.96] and\n[0.96-1.20] was\n[1.20-1.36] it\n[1.68-1.92] what\n[1.92-2.00] it\n[2.00-2.32] isn't\n[2.40-2.56] as\n[2.56-2.72] a\n[2.72-3.12] noted\n[3.12-3.36] uh\n[3.36-3.68] Christian\n[3.68-4.16] theologian\n[4.32-5.04]

No wrapper array. No other fields. Just { ... }.\n\n\n\nVIDEO INPUT:\nA video clip is provided along with this request. The video clip is precisely aligned with the transcript below:\n- The video starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The transcript starts at 0.00 seconds\n- Both are synchronized in the same normalized time coordinate system\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the video frames to visually identify the exact moment boundaries. Look for:\n- Visual cues that indicate the start of the topic/segment\n- Scene changes, speaker changes, or visual transitions\n- The exact frame where the engaging content begins and ends\n- Correlation between what you see and what you hear in the transcript\n\nAnalyze BOTH the video frames and the word-level transcript to determine the most accurate timestamps. The timestamps you output should match this normalized coordinate system (starting from 0.00).\n\nTASK CONTEXT:\nYou are refining the timestamps for an existing video moment. The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Analysis of Ben Shapiro's housing price arguments and policy implications\"\n- Current start time: 29.92 seconds\n- Current end time: 149.92 seconds\n\nIMPORTANT - COORDINATE SYSTEM:\nAll timestamps (transcript, video, and the current moment times above) are in the SAME normalized coordinate system:\n- The clip starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The clip ends at 180.24 seconds\n- Both the transcript and video are aligned to this coordinate system\n- Your output timestamps must also be in this coordinate system (0.00 to 180.24)\n\nThe current timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps. Each line shows:\n- The start and end time of a specific word in seconds (starting from 0.00)\n- The word itself\n\nFormat: [start_time-end_time] word\n\nExample:\n[5.12-5.48] rather\n[5.48-5.76] than\n[5.76-5.92] be\n[5.92-6.24] scared\n\nThe first word in the transcript starts at or near 0.00 seconds.\n\nWord-level transcript:\n[0.00-0.16] how\n[0.16-0.32] the\n[0.32-0.64] betting\n[0.72-0.88] works.\n[1.12-1.28] All\n[1.28-1.52] four\n[1.52-1.60] of\n[1.60-1.76] them.\n[2.00-2.16] But\n[2.16-2.24] I\n[2.24-2.40] do\n[2.40-2.56] think\n[2.56-2.80] Don\n[2.80-3.44]
