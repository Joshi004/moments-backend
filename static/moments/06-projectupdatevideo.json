strong\n[49.20-49.68] progress.\n[49.84-50.16] Over\n[50.16-50.32] the\n[50.32-50.56] past\n[50.56-50.80] few\n[50.80-51.20] weeks,\n[51.36-51.60] we\n[51.60-51.76] have\n[51.76-52.16] built\n[52.16-52.64] multiple\n[52.64-53.44] prototypes\n[53.44-53.68] that\n[53.68-54.16] function\n[54.16-54.32] as\n[54.32-54.48] a\n[54.48-55.04] separate\n[55.04-55.52] service\n[55.52-56.08]

conducting\n[59.76-60.32] extensive\n[60.32-60.80] research\n[60.80-61.04] and\n[61.04-61.76] transcription\n[61.76-62.16] generation,\n[62.40-63.20] identified\n[63.20-63.44] what\n[63.44-63.92] works\n[63.92-64.16] best\n[64.16-64.48] for\n[64.48-64.72] our\n[64.72-65.04] use\n[65.04-65.36] case,\n[65.44-65.68] and\n[65.68-66.00] even\n[66.00-66.40] shared\n[66.40-66.56] the\n[66.56-66.88] results\n[66.88-67.04] with\n[67.04-67.60] Rumble\n[67.76-67.92] to\n[67.92-68.24] help\n[68.24-68.96] unblo\n[68.96-68.96] their\n[69.12-69.76] transcription\n[69.76-70.32] pipeline\n[70.32-70.80] updates.\n[70.88-71.12] In\n[71.12-71.68] parallel,\n[71.92-72.08] we\n[72.08-72.72] developed\n[72.72-73.52] prototypes\n[73.52-73.76] for\n[73.76-74.16] audio\n[74.16-74.72]

addressing\n[83.28-83.36] the\n[83.36-83.76] similar\n[83.76-84.16] challenges.\n[84.32-85.04] Additionally,\n[85.36-85.60] we\n[85.60-86.40] evaluated\n[86.40-86.88] several\n[86.88-87.44] external\n[87.44-88.08] vendors\n[88.08-88.32] to\n[88.32-88.80] understand\n[88.80-89.20] whether\n[89.20-89.44] they\n[89.44-89.68] could\n[89.68-90.24] accelerate\n[90.24-90.32] the\n[90.32-90.88]

we\n[94.96-95.68] concluded\n[95.68-95.92] that\n[95.92-96.16] an\n[96.16-96.72] iterative\n[96.72-97.36] in-house\n[97.36-97.76] approach\n[97.92-98.48] supported\n[98.48-98.64] by\n[98.64-98.80]

gained\n[105.84-106.48] clarity\n[106.48-106.56] on\n[106.56-106.72] the\n[106.72-107.04] key\n[107.04-107.68] challenges\n[107.68-107.92] we\n[107.92-108.24] must\n[108.24-108.80] solve\n[108.80-108.96] to\n[108.96-109.36] reach\n[109.36-109.60] high\n[109.68-110.24] quality\n[110.24-110.88] results.\n[111.12-111.44] Two\n[111.44-111.60] of\n[111.60-111.76] the\n[111.76-112.24]
