The video clip is precisely aligned with the transcript below:\n- The video starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The transcript starts at 0.00 seconds\n- Both are synchronized in the same normalized time coordinate system\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the video frames to visually identify the exact moment boundaries. Look for:\n- Visual cues that indicate the start of the topic/segment\n- Scene changes, speaker changes, or visual transitions\n- The exact frame where the engaging content begins and ends\n- Correlation between what you see and what you hear in the transcript\n\nAnalyze BOTH the video frames and the word-level transcript to determine the most accurate timestamps. The timestamps you output should match this normalized coordinate system (starting from 0.00).\n\nTASK CONTEXT:\nYou are refining the timestamps for an existing video moment. The moment currently has the following information:\n- Title: \"Current focus on two-phased moments generation pipeline\"\n- Current start time: 29.76 seconds\n- Current end time: 86.88 seconds\n\nIMPORTANT - COORDINATE SYSTEM:\nAll timestamps (transcript, video, and the current moment times above) are in the SAME normalized coordinate system:\n- The clip starts at 0.00 seconds\n- The clip ends at 116.96 seconds\n- Both the transcript and video are aligned to this coordinate system\n- Your output timestamps must also be in this coordinate system (0.00 to 116.96)\n\nThe current timestamps may not be precisely aligned with where the content actually begins and ends. Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps. Each line shows:\n- The start and end time of a specific word in seconds (starting from 0.00)\n- The word itself\n\nFormat: [start_time-end_time] word\n\nExample:\n[5.12-5.48] rather\n[5.48-5.76]

Your task is to analyze the word-level transcript and video and determine the exact timestamps where this moment should start and end.\n\nBefore refining the timestamps, let's define what a moment is: A moment is a segment of a video (with its corresponding transcript) that represents something engaging, meaningful, or valuable to the viewer. A moment should be a complete, coherent thought or concept that makes sense on its own.\n\nNow, analyze the word-level transcript and identify the precise start and end timestamps for this moment. The current timestamps may be slightly off. Find the exact point where this topic/segment naturally begins and ends.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Start the moment at the first word that introduces the topic or begins the engaging segment\n- End the moment at the last word that concludes the thought or completes the concept\n- Be precise with word boundaries\n- Ensure the moment captures complete sentences or phrases\n- The refined moment should represent a coherent, engaging segment that makes complete sense on its own\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nYou are provided with word-level timestamps.
