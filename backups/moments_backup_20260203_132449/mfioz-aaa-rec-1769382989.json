today uh with you, though it still feels dreamlike because uh few pounds lighter.\n[191.76] Don't worry, it's just just dehydration.\n[193.28] I don't know uh what kind of food poisoning I got, but uh don't try the shrimp.\n[198.64] And uh, you know, it's one of those you remember that's like you just it's just it's like I've been wrung out.\n[204.08] I've been wrung out.\n[204.88] I uh I don't know what's been going on.\n[206.48] But uh anyway, we have a lot to get to today.\n[209.28] Um lot of people, uh, this is the narrative now.\n[212.32] The bros, the manosphere turning on Donald Trump because they're not getting what they voted for.\n[216.64] Oh boy.\n[220.08] Jeez.\n[221.52] I guess it's over.\n[223.12] Pack up and go home.\n[225.04] Pack up and go home because Theo Vaughn said that uh he doesn't like him, and Andrew Schultz is less than happy.\n[231.68] Hey, have you guys seen this?\n[233.12] Are you getting what you voted for?\n[234.32] We're gonna do it then and now I think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what she actually did on with the show.\n[284.16] As we cross over the Red Sea, we find it.\n[287.04] The kingdom of the House of Sawd.\n[289.12] A place Allah referred to simply as home.\n[291.92] A place that tells you to slow down, remembered your prayers, and to cover up your neck, head, and upper and lower torso.\n[298.96] A place where Sharia law ensures that all men are men, girls are girls who can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we did, and then it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[394.96] Hopefully, it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.60] I keep poisoning you, so I can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first month.\n[1365.76] Go to Pertalk.com slash Crowder.\n[1368.56] If you were just gifted a subscription, take a screenshot, tag me on X or on Instagram.\n[1372.32] And uh, I use their service.\n[1373.44] It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a Rumble Premium subscriber as well.\n[2909.20] Oh, that's uh that's pretty cool.\n[2911.04] Go check it out.\n[2911.76] Along with 100% more of this show, uh you don't get, you know, on the free show,

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers

your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

today uh with you, though it still feels dreamlike because uh few pounds lighter.\n[191.76] Don't worry, it's just just dehydration.\n[193.28] I don't know uh what kind of food poisoning I got, but uh don't try the shrimp.\n[198.64] And uh, you know, it's one of those you remember that's like you just it's just it's like I've been wrung out.\n[204.08] I've been wrung out.\n[204.88] I uh I don't know what's been going on.\n[206.48] But uh anyway, we have a lot to get to today.\n[209.28] Um lot of people, uh, this is the narrative now.\n[212.32] The bros, the manosphere turning on Donald Trump because they're not getting what they voted for.\n[216.64] Oh boy.\n[220.08] Jeez.\n[221.52] I guess it's over.\n[223.12] Pack up and go home.\n[225.04] Pack up and go home because Theo Vaughn said that uh he doesn't like him, and Andrew Schultz is less than happy.\n[231.68] Hey, have you guys seen this?\n[233.12] Are you getting what you voted for?\n[234.32] We're gonna do it then and now I think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what

that tells you to slow down, remembered your prayers, and to cover up your neck, head, and upper and lower torso.\n[298.96] A place where Sharia law ensures that all men are men, girls are girls who can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we did, and then it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[394.96] Hopefully, it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.60] I keep poisoning you, so I can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first month.\n[1365.76] Go to Pertalk.com slash Crowder.\n[1368.56] If you were just gifted a subscription, take a screenshot, tag me on X or on Instagram.\n[1372.32] And uh, I use their service.\n[1373.44] It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers like you, not a foreign caliphate.\n[3128.80] You can join, you can click that button join Rumble Premium.\n[3130.72] Mug Club is Rumble Premium uh Rumble Premium is Mug Club, and if not, let us earn your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what she actually did on with the show.\n[284.16] As we cross over the Red Sea, we find it.\n[287.04] The kingdom of the House of Sawd.\n[289.12] A place Allah referred to simply as home.\n[291.92] A place that tells you to slow down, remembered your prayers, and to cover up your neck, head, and upper and lower torso.\n[298.96] A place where Sharia law ensures that all men are men, girls are girls who can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we did, and then it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[394.96] Hopefully, it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.60] I keep poisoning you, so I can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first

It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a Rumble Premium subscriber as well.\n[2909.20] Oh, that's uh that's pretty cool.\n[2911.04] Go check it out.\n[2911.76] Along with 100% more of this show, uh you don't get, you know, on the free show,

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers like you, not a foreign caliphate.\n[3128.80] You can join, you can click that button join Rumble Premium.\n[3130.72] Mug Club is Rumble Premium uh Rumble Premium is Mug Club, and if not, let us earn your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

today uh with you, though it still feels dreamlike because uh few pounds lighter.\n[191.76] Don't worry, it's just just dehydration.\n[193.28] I don't know uh what kind of food poisoning I got, but uh don't try the shrimp.\n[198.64] And uh, you know, it's one of those you remember that's like you just it's just it's like I've been wrung out.\n[204.08] I've been wrung out.\n[204.88] I uh I don't know what's been going on.\n[206.48] But uh anyway, we have a lot to get to today.\n[209.28] Um lot of people, uh, this is the narrative now.\n[212.32] The bros, the manosphere turning on Donald Trump because they're not getting what they voted for.\n[216.64] Oh boy.\n[220.08] Jeez.\n[221.52] I guess it's over.\n[223.12] Pack up and go home.\n[225.04] Pack up and go home because Theo Vaughn said that uh he doesn't like him, and Andrew Schultz is less than happy.\n[231.68] Hey, have you guys seen this?\n[233.12] Are you getting what you voted for?\n[234.32] We're gonna do it then and now I think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what

that tells you to slow down, remembered your prayers, and to cover up your neck, head, and upper and lower torso.\n[298.96] A place where Sharia law ensures that all men are men, girls are girls who can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we did, and then it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[394.96] Hopefully, it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.60] I keep poisoning you, so I can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first month.\n[1365.76] Go to Pertalk.com slash Crowder.\n[1368.56] If you were just gifted a subscription, take a screenshot, tag me on X or on Instagram.\n[1372.32] And uh, I use their service.\n[1373.44] It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll

you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers like you, not a foreign caliphate.\n[3128.80] You can join, you can click that button join Rumble Premium.\n[3130.72] Mug Club is Rumble Premium uh Rumble Premium is Mug Club, and if not, let us earn your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that

can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first

It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a Rumble Premium subscriber as well.\n[2909.20] Oh, that's uh that's pretty cool.\n[2911.04] Go check it out.\n[2911.76] Along with 100% more of this show, uh you don't get, you know, on the free show, and you get 100% more of all the other shows, everything ad-free, and now you get Perplexity AI.\n[2919.04] That is wonderful.\n[2920.24] So the new Saudi Arabian Comedy Festival uh is going on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers like you, not a foreign caliphate.\n[3128.80] You can join, you can click that button join Rumble Premium.\n[3130.72] Mug Club is Rumble Premium uh Rumble Premium is Mug Club, and if not, let us earn your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

today uh with you, though it still feels dreamlike because uh few pounds lighter.\n[191.76] Don't worry, it's just just dehydration.\n[193.28] I don't know uh what kind of food poisoning I got, but uh don't try the shrimp.\n[198.64] And uh, you know, it's one of those you remember that's like you just it's just it's like I've been wrung out.\n[204.08] I've been wrung out.\n[204.88] I uh I don't know what's been going on.\n[206.48] But uh anyway, we have a lot to get to today.\n[209.28] Um lot of people, uh, this is the narrative now.\n[212.32] The bros, the manosphere turning on Donald Trump because they're not getting what they voted for.\n[216.64] Oh boy.\n[220.08] Jeez.\n[221.52] I guess it's over.\n[223.12] Pack up and go home.\n[225.04] Pack up and go home because Theo Vaughn said that uh he doesn't like him, and Andrew Schultz is less than happy.\n[231.68] Hey, have you guys seen this?\n[233.12] Are you getting what you voted for?\n[234.32] We're gonna do it then and now I think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what

that tells you to slow down, remembered your prayers, and to cover up your neck, head, and upper and lower torso.\n[298.96] A place where Sharia law ensures that all men are men, girls are girls who can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we did, and then it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[394.96] Hopefully, it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.60] I keep poisoning you, so I can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first month.\n[1365.76] Go to Pertalk.com slash Crowder.\n[1368.56] If you were just gifted a subscription, take a screenshot, tag me on X or on Instagram.\n[1372.32] And uh, I use their service.\n[1373.44] It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers

your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we

why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first

It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a Rumble Premium subscriber as well.\n[2909.20] Oh, that's uh that's pretty cool.\n[2911.04] Go check it out.\n[2911.76] Along with 100% more of this show, uh you don't get, you know, on the free show, and you get 100% more of all the other shows, everything ad-free, and now you get Perplexity AI.\n[2919.04] That is wonderful.\n[2920.24] So the new Saudi Arabian Comedy Festival uh is going on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers like you, not a foreign caliphate.\n[3128.80] You can join, you can click that button join Rumble Premium.\n[3130.72] Mug Club is Rumble Premium uh Rumble Premium is Mug Club, and if not, let us earn your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

today uh with you, though it still feels dreamlike because uh few pounds lighter.\n[191.76] Don't worry, it's just just dehydration.\n[193.28] I don't know uh what kind of food poisoning I got, but uh don't try the shrimp.\n[198.64] And uh, you know, it's one of those you remember that's like you just it's just it's like I've been wrung out.\n[204.08] I've been wrung out.\n[204.88] I uh I don't know what's been going on.\n[206.48] But uh anyway, we have a lot to get to today.\n[209.28] Um lot of people, uh, this is the narrative now.\n[212.32] The bros, the manosphere turning on Donald Trump because they're not getting what they voted for.\n[216.64] Oh boy.\n[220.08] Jeez.\n[221.52] I guess it's over.\n[223.12] Pack up and go home.\n[225.04] Pack up and go home because Theo Vaughn said that uh he doesn't like him, and Andrew Schultz is less than happy.\n[231.68] Hey, have you guys seen this?\n[233.12] Are you getting what you voted for?\n[234.32] We're gonna do it then and now I think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what she actually did on with the show.\n[284.16] As we cross over the Red Sea, we find it.\n[287.04] The kingdom of the House of Sawd.\n[289.12] A place Allah referred to simply as home.\n[291.92] A place that tells you to slow down, remembered your prayers, and to cover up your neck, head, and upper and lower torso.\n[298.96] A place where Sharia law ensures that all men are men, girls are girls who can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we did, and then it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[394.96] Hopefully, it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.60] I keep poisoning you, so I can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first month.\n[1365.76] Go to Pertalk.com slash Crowder.\n[1368.56] If you were just gifted a subscription, take a screenshot, tag me on X or on Instagram.\n[1372.32] And uh, I use their service.\n[1373.44] It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a Rumble Premium subscriber as well.\n[2909.20] Oh, that's uh that's pretty cool.\n[2911.04] Go check it out.\n[2911.76] Along with 100% more of this show, uh you don't get, you know, on the free show,

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers

your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what

can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we

why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first month.\n[1365.76] Go to Pertalk.com slash Crowder.\n[1368.56] If you were just gifted a subscription, take a screenshot, tag me on X or on Instagram.\n[1372.32] And uh, I use their service.\n[1373.44] It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a Rumble Premium subscriber as well.\n[2909.20] Oh, that's uh that's pretty cool.\n[2911.04] Go check it out.\n[2911.76] Along with 100% more of this show, uh you don't get, you know, on the free show,

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers like you, not a foreign caliphate.\n[3128.80] You can join, you can click that button join Rumble Premium.\n[3130.72] Mug Club is Rumble Premium uh Rumble Premium is Mug Club, and if not, let us earn your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

because they're not getting what they voted for.\n[216.64] Oh boy.\n[220.08] Jeez.\n[221.52] I guess it's over.\n[223.12] Pack up and go home.\n[225.04] Pack up and go home because Theo Vaughn said that uh he doesn't like him, and Andrew Schultz is less than happy.\n[231.68] Hey, have you guys seen this?\n[233.12] Are you getting what you voted for?\n[234.32] We're gonna do it then and now I think we're getting almost no, no, not almost.\n[238.08] We're getting exactly what we voted for.\n[240.32] But what can you expect from a community where um a lot of people who lament the violation of human rights here uh, you know, by requiring identification to vote, uh, but they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44] There's that comedy festival in Riyadh.\n[259.04] We'll talk about that and Candace Owens look has irrefutable proof that we will get to the Jews did it with a lemon squeezer.\n[270.24] Point blank, Charlie Kirk.\n[272.16] That seems in poor taste, but it'll seem like it's even uh in in more poor taste when you see what she actually did on with the show.\n[284.16] As we cross over the Red Sea, we find it.\n[287.04] The kingdom of the House of Sawd.\n[289.12] A place Allah referred to simply as home.\n[291.92] A place that tells you to slow down, remembered your prayers, and to cover up your neck, head, and upper and lower torso.\n[298.96] A place where Sharia law ensures that all men are men, girls are girls who can't drive, and a clitoris is all but a distant vanished memory.\n[307.28] A place somewhere over the sunset above the Red Sea.\n[310.32] We hear the laughter of young boys, the lamentations of infidels, and the bleeding of goats.\n[315.76] It's a place where the number of public beheadings is surpassed only by the funding of global terrorism and gross abuse of basic human rights.\n[324.48]

very sick still.\n[384.80] You don't sound it right now.\n[385.76] I have I went years without getting a stomach bug.\n[388.24] And then election night, you know, it's hooked up to an IV before we did, and then it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[394.96] Hopefully, it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.60] I keep poisoning you, so I can show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you, uh, before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudi's?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand.\n[420.08] I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.64] No.\n[425.04] Uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good.\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah.\n[429.28] Glad you're back.\n[429.84] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.76] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good.\n[435.52] You know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.28] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds and we have a black and white and the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th, at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.72] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No, I no, I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.20] I also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's a thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fit.\n[509.28] Ah, okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers, you should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 410.\n[545.28] And he looks like he is so mad that he is 410 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.32] Yeah, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is\n[590.40] To authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.08] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.08] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.56] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.40] Is it?\n[616.64] Okay.\n[617.12] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You said to laugh at them, we heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.32] Okay.\n[625.04] I'm not here to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.68] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.36] Well, yeah, you're you go overcompensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income, like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.64] I'm from York, York, Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.80] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell.\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxdale?\n[661.68] Which is the Bible.\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.92] But here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.00] Every every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.48] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.64] Um she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way, because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because then everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no, your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.92] If you want to get other people to laugh at Stephen Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.20] AOC and people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[738.00] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think whatever it is, a Snapchat Live, Instagram.\n[742.80] I have no idea what what it was that was it, TikTok.\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.76] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller, uh, 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average on CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.60] You are profiling brown people that that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.28] That is the it's such a Oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks, they're taking jobs away from whites, they're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.80] That's not exactly a no, Stephen.\n[782.56] Can you just unaccurately state that he does not?\n[785.84] I said it's a dumb question.\n[788.24] It meant no.\n[789.20] Well, I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.60] So the full answer is no, that is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller, there's a little touch of tism there.\n[803.52] I mean, he's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.72] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe it.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah.\n[815.60] This is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.40] Were you about to say something, Noodles?\n[819.60] Yeah, I'm not the model of height, but you're short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.92] Yeah.\n[824.24] Wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[828.00] No.\n[828.32] We didn't we didn't uh hurt his security ever in this office.\n[831.76] It doesn't really work because a short guy knows he's short.\n[834.40] And if you say you're short to a guy 5'10, you're just like, yeah, but I'm not though.\n[838.00] Whatever.\n[838.80] Like it's just it's just it's a no win.\n[841.04] You know, like if you want to make fun of someone for being fat, like it doesn't work on a really, really fat guy because he knows he's fat.\n[846.00] Right.\n[846.16] Yeah.\n[846.64] You have to do it like a dad who's gained like a few pounds, who you know is self-conscious about it because he's hoping people don't notice.\n[852.48] So, like, if he was just slightly below average, maybe if he was like 5'7, it might work.\n[856.64] But if 5'10, he's right in there, it's just a totally irrelevant attack.\n[860.32] It also has to be a joke.\n[861.36] You can't just say the thing.\n[862.32] That's all she did.\n[863.04] She goes, he's short, laugh at him.\n[865.04] Like, that wasn't a joke.\n[866.00] That was just a statement.\n[866.96] It also wasn't true.\n[867.76] You can't do that with a like a fat joke.\n[869.44] It doesn't work if someone goes, uh, Feierstein's fat.\n[871.76] I'm like, yeah, I am.\n[873.04] You gotta make a joke, like, uh, he looks like the kind of guy who eats calzones because he's too lazy to fold his own pizza or whatever.\n[878.40] Right.\n[879.20] Yes, put my name on that.\n[880.40] Say like that.\n[881.28] What the hell?\n[881.84] You gotta have a joke with it, dum-dum.\n[884.32] And then they'll also say that words are violence, but silence is violence.\n[887.12] So I don't know what to do in the world.\n[888.40] Here's a th they're okay with insults so long as they suck.\n[891.28] Yeah.\n[891.84] They're okay with him as long as they suck.\n[893.52] Exactly.\n[893.84] Donald Trump, they they they got all over his case because hell, he tweets me, and I'm like, no, he is really good at pissing you guys off and you hate it.\n[900.64] Yes.\n[900.96] And you tell him that he shouldn't do that, but you should go make fun of these people, and that's how you deal with them.\n[904.80] So speaking of making fun, we have to be careful on that because this is trending right now.\n[908.96] Um be careful.\n[911.12] Candace Owens.\n[912.32] And look, look.\n[914.00] I understand, and this is one of those things I don't want, I think that there's such a huge uh coalition of evil that we are facing that uh you know I'm not a huge fan of infighting for the sake of infighting and clicks on the right.\n[926.00] But I also know that there are some people who were pretty close uh to Charlie Kirk who are not thrilled with what's been going on lately.\n[932.00] And that doesn't mean that people who can be close to someone who obviously is at the center of the strategy, someone who was assassinated in cold blood.\n[938.72] It doesn't mean that people around him can't be wrong.\n[940.64] Right.\n[941.36] But it also doesn't mean that Candace Owens is right.\n[943.68] In journalism uh does matter if you're going to claim journalism.\n[946.56] Yeah.\n[946.80] So Candace Owens just released some screenshots of an alleged group chat.\n[951.60] Now, I I don't know if we don't know at this point in time if they're real if they're not.\n[954.80] I I I would uh wager they probably are.\n[957.68] Let's assume they are.\n[958.64] And this thread was released to back up her claim.\n[963.12] These are the receipts that prove that I I guess maybe it's more than likely that Charlie Kirk was on the outs with and likely taken out by Israel, the Jews.\n[973.92] So Charlie writes in the screw chat just lost another huge Jewish donor.\n[978.56] Uh two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.\n[983.20] I'm thinking of inviting Candace.\n[985.20] Somebody writes, uh Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes.\n[991.52] I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause.\n[1000.96] And somebody writes, donor writes, please do not invite Candace.\n[1004.40] That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion.\n[1007.84] Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions.\n[1010.96] That nasty free will thing that God bestow on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.\n[1017.92] So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kassade, he was very clear and he was very explicit, and he did not back down out in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread.\n[1028.88] I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven.\n[1032.56] Conveniently, she also released this thread.\n[1038.16] Oh no.\n[1039.36] Well, that seems pretty cut and dry.\n[1040.96] Does he have a phone in prison?\n[1043.68] I don't know.\n[1044.40] Yeah, the sodomy snuck him one in.\n[1047.12] Very nice.\n[1048.16] Look, uh here's the thing.\n[1049.52] I will say this.\n[1050.40] Um I don't doubt that that's authentic.\n[1052.88] And by the way, for the same reasons that I have avoided uh any associations with nonprofits, really, for at least at least a decade, even speaking at nonprofit as well.\n[1061.44] Right.\n[1061.68] Yeah.\n[1062.08] Because I understand too, that there are a lot of donors, and it it comes with strings attached.\n[1065.76] We are funded by viewers like you, right?\n[1067.28] We're funded by mugs, not a foreign caliphate and not some kind of entity that wants us to advocate on behalf of a government.\n[1072.24] So I don't doubt that that was probably true.\n[1074.32] And I don't doubt that Charlie Kirk was probably frustrated with some Jewish donors who made up likely a large contingency of donors to conservative causes who wanted to bridle his opinions or or guide him in what he said a little bit.\n[1087.68] That is a very far cry from assassinating him, though.\n[1092.48] And here's the other thing.\n[1093.68] That can be true.\n[1095.76] And it can be true at the same time as Charlie Kirk was expressing on Megan Kelly.\n[1100.80] He had problems with these donors.\n[1101.84] He had problems with these people who were trying to guide him in ways that uh he should communicate or how he could criticize Israel or if he was allowed to at all.\n[1109.84] And he could still support Israel, which seems like he did very consistently against Hamas.\n[1115.04] You can take a snapshot from someone's life.\n[1116.64] You could do that with this show.\n[1117.52] Let's say I were to die uh tomorrow.\n[1121.28] You could take one clip from this show and go, oh wait, I think Candace did it, because look, he made fun of her.\n[1126.24] Right?\n[1126.40] It's like, well, yeah, but there were 50 other things that I say.\n[1128.32] You'd also say AOC did it.\n[1129.92] Let's say I were to die.\n[1131.84] Let's say I happen to die two days after I did a segment on why I hate APAC.\n[1136.32] People could cobble that together to go, see, the Jews took him out.\n[1139.52] Because I did do that segment.\n[1140.80] Yeah.\n[1141.20] Let me state a fact.\n[1142.96] APAC gives to far left anti-American Democrats.\n[1147.36] Yes, that's a fact.\n[1148.48] Now, of course, they give to plenty of Republican candidates, conservatives, sure.\n[1151.84] But the fact remains.\n[1153.52] They give to far left Democrats as well.\n[1156.64] 2025.\n[1158.48] My opinion, I don't like APEC.\n[1160.56] So I am saying if I ever happen to be assassinated, yes, the Jews did it.\n[1163.44] Yes, it was the Jews.\n[1166.40] Listen, I I need to uh uh I apologize because I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna go through these receipts and see, you know, what these receipts are receding.\n[1173.20] And I I said, hey, is like Charlie Kirk's opinion on Israel, that was pretty well known that he was being he was beginning to be very frustrated with with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his Facebook.\n[1180.16] Frustrated with what was going on.\n[1181.44] Maybe the pressure he was receiving, actually what he was seeing over in Israel happening with the war on Gaza, or even from the students that he was talking to on campus.\n[1188.08] I'm sure he was hearing it in all in his face all the time.\n[1191.36] But we knew that already.\n[1192.88] Okay, so that's the one thing out.\n[1194.16] Okay, the next thing was the two million dollar.\n[1195.92] And I thought that was news.\n[1197.04] So I apologize.\n[1197.92] I thought I said that that was news from this thing.\n[1200.00] It wasn't, turns out.\n[1200.88] Tucker Carlson talked about it uh already a couple of weeks ago.\n[1203.28] I think it was written about.\n[1204.08] I don't remember which paper, New York Times or Wall Street Journal, something like that.\n[1207.04] I can't remember which one.\n[1208.48] So really we're we're left with what in this text thread.\n[1212.40] And literally everybody who's been a Candace supporter, and I'm not a Candace hater either.\n[1217.36] I am a truth seeker.\n[1219.28] I want to know what actually happened to Charlie.\n[1221.44] If there's anything other than what the official story is, I absolutely want to know.\n[1224.64] I don't trust the FBI.\n[1225.76] I don't trust that we're always gonna get the straight story from anybody on stuff like this.\n[1229.52] I want to know what led up to it, who was involved, and I want to make sure that they are held accountable.\n[1234.00] That being said, I haven't seen receipts for literally anything in this thread.\n[1237.92] No, no, I haven't.\n[1239.60] She could do that later.\n[1240.32] And we have seen receipts with our own lion eyes and ears.\n[1242.16] We did that entire segment, right?\n[1243.28] Where you see uh Robinson, you see him that day of.\n[1246.24] We only went through what we could verify with our own eyes on video camera.\n[1249.44] Him in an outfit, okay, scoping out the school, him in a separate outfit getting to that uh balcony where he fired the shot, okay, fully assembled rifle in a towel.\n[1257.36] We saw him jumping off, we saw him run across the quad.\n[1259.76] Like all these things that we we we we saw, right?\n[1262.24] The bullet engravings, which was leaked to us by the DOD or someone underneath the umbrella of DOD, DOJ.\n[1267.60] Um so when people what'll happen is they'll give you this snippet of information.\n[1271.68] Okay, Charlie Kirk was maybe upset with some Jewish donors.\n[1273.84] I don't doubt that for a second.\n[1276.00] How is that more though?\n[1277.68] The compared to the preponderance of evidence that we have that a radicalized LGBTQ AIP sympathist, which by the way does not seem to defy the bounds of reason at this point, considering how radical and violent the left has become.\n[1289.12] How does this seem more likely than someone shot him?\n[1293.28] Someone shot him because they hated what he had to say, and that's the reason he had security there in the first place because he knew that there are people on the left who were trying to kill him and assassinate him.\n[1300.32] That's where we need to apply the same standards of journalism.\n[1302.96] Yeah.\n[1303.28] Um, if there's more that comes out, and it's like, oh, and the textbook says, hey, by the way, uh tomorrow, are we having a meetup tomorrow before we assassinate Charlie Kirk?\n[1309.20] Uh signed Massad.\n[1310.24] It's like, okay, good.\n[1310.88] Then I'll if I get that.\n[1311.76] That's I won't have a problem with it.\n[1313.52] I mean, I'll have a problem with it, but I won't have a problem with the journalism.\n[1316.00] We will we will acknowledge our error, be admonished, and uh make apologies.\n[1320.08] Sorry.\n[1320.56] There we go.\n[1321.76] It's like a future thing.\n[1323.04] Jeez.\n[1323.60] Yes.\n[1324.32] Preemptive.\n[1324.88] My short.\n[1325.44] But you were wrong about the uh about whether it was news or not.\n[1328.40] So that was wrong.\n[1330.56] You were that's true.\n[1331.44] So yeah.\n[1334.08] All right.\n[1334.88] My short-term memory is nothing right now because I'm still incredibly dehydrated.\n[1337.84] But you know how you guys, some people they do like super chats where you send in money where it's like, hey, here's 50 bucks, you know, show us your nipples.\n[1343.60] I love those.\n[1344.16] Yeah.\n[1344.56] We don't do that.\n[1345.28] We do the opposite.\n[1345.84] That's only fancy.\n[1346.72] It's time for reverse super chat.\n[1351.60] That's right.\n[1352.56] Reverse super chat.\n[1353.60] The folks at Pure Talk.\n[1354.96] Yeah.\n[1355.36] Want to get back to the given 50 free rumble premium subscriptions right now.\n[1358.72] They were just gifted in the chat.\n[1359.84] That's from Pure Talk is 100% U.S.\n[1362.24] based customer service, veteran-led company.\n[1364.24] You can say 50% off your first

It's better.\n[1373.92] I I think I'm allowed to say this legally.\n[1375.20] It's better than when I was with Verizon, like significantly better.\n[1377.68] Just don't use your current cell phone while you transfer your service over to the next phone.\n[1384.24] Because then you just lose the call.\n[1385.92] Carl, and you have to call somebody else to borrow their phone.\n[1388.40] You can't do that.\n[1389.12] But my idiocy has nothing to do.\n[1390.80] You're probably you're probably a little more sharp than that.\n[1393.60] This has been reverse super chat.\n[1398.16] Seriously, it's actually been way better service.\n[1400.00] That's good.\n[1400.48] Yeah.\n[1401.44] Why pay the big boys and uh give money to people who hate you?\n[1404.48] Is that why you've been ignoring my calls?\n[1406.16] Pretty much.\n[1406.96] No, I just that one's set to Or is that really bad service?\n[1409.84] Yeah, let's I don't know which it is.\n[1411.92] I feel cornered in my brain isn't working well.\n[1414.00] I'll just say I'll just blame Gerald.\n[1416.72] It's not only that you don't like donors pulling strings, you don't like to be sponsored by anybody because he would come close to doing like yeah.\n[1424.16] I look at this like the same issues with Daily Wire.\n[1425.84] They said, you know, when when there was a 50 million dollar con for this whole studio, it was like, yeah, but then we would have to play ball with YouTube and make sure we don't talk about vaccines and make sure that we don't talk about election interference.\n[1435.68] So the answer is no.\n[1436.96] I never took uh took people up on the trips to Israel because like, yeah, look, I would love to visit Israel sometime and certainly see all these historical spots and and go there and take a tour.\n[1446.00] But I don't want to do it on someone else's dime and owe somebody something.\n[1448.72] So I do wonder why these people who've done this and made their entire career off of it now, you know, are holier than now.\n[1455.12] Like, yeah, but I've known this since 2008, 2009.\n[1458.48] So, like you took the money.\n[1461.04] Be honest about the fact that you took money from donors before and now you don't like them.\n[1465.12] I haven't.\n[1465.76] And I also understand that.\n[1466.96] I also can imagine why Charlie would have been frustrated.\n[1469.60] I can that that's always the case working with non-profit.\n[1471.84] I think that's fair to do, too, by the way, to be to if you're to take money from a donor as a nonprofit, and then later go, hey, I don't I don't like what they're doing to me.\n[1478.80] That's totally fair to do.\n[1480.00] Sure.\n[1480.32] Yeah.\n[1480.64] Yeah, to pull your money, but you're constantly dancing for I mean, look, the the the two million dollars probably represents around three percent of their annual operating budget over at TP USA, according to the latest figures could be a little off.\n[1491.12] So it's not the end of the world, but certainly if you had 10 of those kind of get together, then obviously you've got a little bit of a problem in funding.\n[1497.20] I get it.\n[1497.68] That makes sense.\n[1498.32] So it's one of the reasons we don't do that.\n[1500.00] Yep.\n[1500.40] No, I I understand it.\n[1501.60] But uh look, I'll I'll I'll uh I'll be interested to see if there's any other evidence that comes out.\n[1505.44] I'm just it's really a wait and see approach.\n[1507.52] Anything else?\n[1507.92] No?\n[1508.24] No.\n[1509.20] So if you've been paying attention uh during this election, well, since the election.\n[1514.16] I I don't know what this is what's going on.\n[1515.60] I'll just tell you this.\n[1516.24] I don't understand why people don't understand like, oh, this isn't what I voted for.\n[1519.36] What?\n[1520.00] No.\n[1520.48] I mean, this is exactly what I voted for.\n[1522.24] I get it.\n[1522.56] They had no sponsor.\n[1523.28] Yeah.\n[1523.68] Maybe there's a few things.\n[1524.48] There's a few.\n[1525.04] We talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's a few things where I'm like, uh, I didn't expect it to go this way.\n[1529.12] Yeah.\n[1529.60] But the compromise is I get what I want.\n[1532.24] Yeah.\n[1532.64] It's very efficient.\n[1534.24] Yeah.\n[1534.80] Some of the things aren't being done the way I would like them to, but there's a there's a word.\n[1538.96] There's a narrative out there right now where people are saying, you know what?\n[1541.68] I was all in on uh on Trump.\n[1543.36] And also, let's just be clear.\n[1544.56] Let's also apply these timelines.\n[1546.24] Donald Trump, very popular, liberalism, losing ground consistently in social media and in the media sphere, especially with young voters, right?\n[1554.24] So during this period of time, people are going, yeah, MAGA, baby.\n[1556.72] It's fun.\n[1557.12] Let's troll the libs.\n[1558.48] And now that he's in office and doing exactly what I voted for, what I actually championed.\n[1563.28] A lot of these people are going, uh, we need to be um we need to be adversarial and no.\n[1569.28] I I don't know what he's doing.\n[1570.64] This isn't cool with me.\n[1571.52] I don't understand it.\n[1572.72] You comment below.\n[1573.84] Are are you surprised or do you feel like you've been gypped by this administration?\n[1578.32] Again, none is perfect.\n[1581.04] It's been probably the most effective uh administration, maybe maybe less than the first Trump administration, but certainly among the most effective administrations in my lifetime.\n[1591.68] But that has not stopped some people who claim to be amongst you uh from turning on them.\n[1597.04] The Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions.\n[1606.40] I don't think anybody was signed up for that.\n[1607.76] Now I gotta look back at it, it's like, damn, like so many people just time you do it, and now it's just like f like no matter what, they don't even get to know who I am.\n[1616.72] Because they don't like even want to.\n[1618.08] Oh, you did this shit with Trump.\n[1619.52] You see what your boy's doing?\n[1620.72] You voted for this.\n[1621.44] I'm like, I voted for none of this.\n[1624.08] He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\n[1627.04] Right.\n[1627.28] One of the things is I voted for all.\n[1634.96] Increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like uh the our hearts with blood and like per and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being an American.\n[1646.80] They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right?\n[1651.92] And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided.\n[1655.76] Like that's crazy.\n[1656.72] And I really really understand.\n[1658.00] Criminals don't go there.\n[1659.12] Other people's side, and as I'm getting older, I'm just like seeing like I just don't think I'll ever care enough again.\n[1665.84] I want him to shrink spending, reduce the money.\n[1668.80] He's increasing it.\n[1669.76] It's like everything that he said he's gonna do except sending immigrants back.\n[1674.88] Everything and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.\n[1677.84] And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for.\n[1682.08] And then now that we're caught up here, and it feels like we are just working for Israel.\n[1688.00] Uh I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know.\n[1691.76] You you just really start to feel very disillusioned uh pretty quickly.\n[1696.40] Just really quickly, too, that note on on Israel.\n[1699.28] I don't think we've ever seen a president be more quote unquote disrespectful to Netanyahu than Donald Trump.\n[1705.76] Yes.\n[1706.08] Ever.\n[1706.32] He's insulted him.\n[1707.20] He's he's literally insulted him for being petulant for being kind of bitchy for being negative.\n[1711.84] You may not like that Donald Trump supports Israel in the conflict, you know, as it relates to uh Israel Hamas.\n[1718.08] You may not like that, but as far as actually dealing with Netanyahu and saying, hey, we have to get a peace deal done.\n[1722.72] Barack Obama, Joe Biden were more respectful of the Israeli government than Donald Trump.\n[1727.76] He's spoken with them just as frankly as he does with Democrats here.\n[1731.60] So this also, you know, it comes in the heels of yesterday.\n[1734.48] Um, a Rolling Stone article highlighted this.\n[1737.04] They call it a phenomenon where it's they they titled it, Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump are now cooling on him.\n[1743.92] Oh boy.\n[1746.16] Okay.\n[1746.72] All right.\n[1747.20] Sunday NBC News wrote uh pod man out.\n[1751.52] Trump support among influential podcasters is waning.\n[1756.24] Bro, did ask and yeah, you just saw that even um, you know, a lot of people have podcast everyone has a podcast now.\n[1764.16] That's the issue.\n[1764.64] Even Darth Vader turned on Trump has seen in his podcast, uh Call Me Your Father yesterday.\n[1769.92] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.16] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before.\n[1770.08] I find President Trump's actions disturbing.\n[1774.24] Look, and I will tell you this.\n[1775.84] Too many podcasts.\n[1776.96] Yeah, there's too many podcasts.\n[1778.64] I've been here before there was sort of this resurgence of right wing with young men, and I'll be here after.\n[1783.68] Popularity, it comes in waves, right?\n[1786.64] It'll wane.\n[1787.52] That doesn't change the principles and doesn't change your vision for our country.\n[1792.72] And that's what I find disturbing about this.\n[1795.20] Yeah, but look, you should not really be surprised about this.\n[1797.92] Like these these people don't really have much of a spine, and we've kind of seen this coming for a little while.\n[1805.60] Come on, let's old bar does remote.\n[1808.32] I'm gonna have the next pitch borrow.\n[1810.40] Right past the flag.\n[1811.68] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1816.96] You know what?\n[1817.52] You know what really bothers me too?\n[1818.48] The Johnny come lately is the comedians now who are like, oh yeah, Trump it's like really?\n[1821.60] Because I remember when I was in a comedy club and you acted like anyone who said, Yeah, I don't think same sex marriage should be a thing, was a fascist.\n[1827.12] When I tried to explain back to the I don't think you know, it just seems that men and women are interchangeable.\n[1831.52] This is gonna be a gender bending slippery slope.\n[1834.00] Ugh, fascist, dumb conservative, dumb Christian.\n[1836.96] Now all of a sudden they embrace it because the leftists came for them.\n[1839.68] It's like, well, what did you think was gonna happen?\n[1842.00] All right, let's go to the next one.\n[1843.52] All right.\n[1844.08] I know you were never that way.\n[1845.12] That's also why I appreciate you.\n[1846.16] But so many people now are like, yeah, I'm pro-freedom.\n[1848.24] Really?\n[1848.88] Where where were you in 2005?\n[1850.96] No, 2009, 2014, huh?\n[1854.24] Oh, mocking people like us.\n[1856.08] But now you get it.\n[1856.96] Now you get it.\n[1858.88] Come let's old power does remote.\n[1861.60] I'm gonna have the next pitch ball.\n[1863.68] Right past the flag.\n[1864.96] We're gonna win the game, I guarantee.\n[1871.20] And I think you guys are grown up enough.\n[1873.12] Uh I I know you well enough, the person watching or listening right now that you're you're not gonna be led astray by someone who's popular in the moment and agrees with you and then disagrees with you.\n[1881.44] You're not gonna let them veer you off course.\n[1882.96] And not everyone feels this way, by the way.\n[1884.16] Osmond Gold, who has not held himself out as any type of conservative bro or anything like that.\n[1888.72] He posted something pretty pretty damn sensible last night.\n[1890.96] He wrote, aside from the Epstein stuff, Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[1894.32] Maybe there's too many crying cairons on social media, so they're afraid of the optics, but this seems so dishonest.\n[1899.12] It won't work either.\n[1900.24] The bridge is burned, and those people will always hate them.\n[1903.68] Yeah, I think that's pretty well said.\n[1905.52] Yeah.\n[1905.92] Um, I don't know about Andrew Schultz and Theoban and these people.\n[1909.04] I I don't know how you can say I'm surprised that Donald Trump is deporting people.\n[1912.00] I I don't know how you could possibly be surprised by that.\n[1914.96] Also, Donald Trump is probably the Republican who in recent memory, probably the least the Republican who placed the least emphasis on uh just downsizing government.\n[1925.68] Yeah.\n[1925.92] And the reason for that is because every Republican is promised it never really done it.\n[1928.88] So his platform was we're gonna trim waste, but we're going to make this huge government at least work for its people, because it's almost impossible to truly downsize government.\n[1938.32] Yeah.\n[1938.56] And I'm more fiscally conservative than President Trump.\n[1941.28] That's true, but I knew what I voted for.\n[1943.28] I didn't think that I was voting for a Rand Paul type candidate.\n[1946.40] Yeah.\n[1946.72] Well, and it's also like when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and made it into X and then started talking about free speech.\n[1953.68] We're like, he has no idea.\n[1955.12] He hasn't been steeped in this.\n[1956.16] He's brand new to the cause.\n[1957.44] So many of these people are in the same boat right now.\n[1959.76] They're brand new to the cause, and they have no idea that when you say, I am for deporting illegals and making sure that we don't have tens of millions of people here illegally.\n[1969.44] That means it's going to be messy.\n[1971.52] It means it's going to tug at your heartstrings when you see footage and you see the media spin up narratives.\n[1977.36] They had no idea that it meant doing hard things.\n[1980.24] And they're like, whoa, that's actually hard, and people don't like that.\n[1982.56] Yeah, of course.\n[1983.20] Nobody likes to be told that they have to leave the country they're in illegally.\n[1986.48] Of course.\n[1986.96] And of course the Democrats want to run a campaign against the Republicans and make it look like something it isn't.\n[1991.84] Of course.\n[1992.64] Where have you been this entire time?\n[1994.56] We're not trying to be mean.\n[1996.08] We're just trying to do what is right for the American citizens.\n[1998.56] Right.\n[1998.80] And you guys are running for cover because you have no spines at all.\n[2003.60] At all.\n[2004.64] Also because he's doing the bidding of the Jews, I guess.\n[2006.64] Ah, do you have a stinger for then and now?\n[2008.96] Yes, I do.\n[2009.52] All right.\n[2009.68] Well, you know what?\n[2010.16] This actually let's let's actually contrast this during his campaign.\n[2014.00] And today, again, all references available, link in the description.\n[2016.56] Let's let's let's hit a then and now.\n[2024.88] Okay, so these people feel they didn't get what they voted for, assuming they voted.\n[2029.04] Uh let's go to Donald Trump then on immigration.\n[2032.96] He wanted.\n[2035.36] Switch it.\n[2037.92] There you go.\n[2039.12] Did all of you get food poisoning?\n[2040.96] I'm just looking down.\n[2041.92] Yes.\n[2042.40] Just avoid the shrimp.\n[2043.36] I have no buttons.\n[2044.48] This is President Trump then on immigration.\n[2047.60] Massive uh deportations.\n[2050.00] We will seal the border.\n[2051.68] We will stop the invasion immediately.\n[2053.76] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have no choice.\n[2062.08] Okay, so if he didn't do that, I'd be upset because it wouldn't be what I voted for.\n[2065.68] Right.\n[2066.00] Let's go to Donald Trump now with large-scale deportations.\n[2070.88] Come on.\n[2071.28] I've been clear from day one.\n[2072.72] I mean, sanctuary cities, especially a lot of the non-criminals are being resident in sanctuary cities.\n[2077.60] Because we're all looking for the criminal because they chose to release him in the community.\n[2081.44] We gotta go to the community and find him.\n[2083.36] And when we find them, when we find them, if we find them, many times are with others.\n[2087.60] Others are in the United States illegally, but not a criminal target, for they're coming too.\n[2093.04] It's like a bO-go.\n[2097.20] Led 300 federal officials to that apartment complex.\n[2101.44] Some even repelled down from blackhawks onto the rooftop in order to help secure that perimeter.\n[2111.84] Federal agents raided a strip club in the city.\n[2115.76] Chica sporitas cabaret.\n[2117.36] It's also very high.\n[2118.64] Ice agents say they arrested 41 non-citizens, most of them club employees on immigration violations.\n[2129.68] That's what he said.\n[2130.88] So we're honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.\n[2134.16] We're not a travel booking agency.\n[2136.00] It's not it's not our job to say to illegal alien terrorists.\n[2140.40] Pick your favorite destination in the world and we'll send you a charter jet there.\n[2146.56] We're getting back to the two hours.\n[2154.72] But if we find an illegal alien in the process of doing that, they're going to be arrested too.\n[2159.52] By the way, is there anything more powerless seeming than some than a handcuffed hand giving them a little finger?\n[2165.20] Yeah.\n[2165.84] Yeah, you really told me.\n[2167.04] Okay.\n[2167.60] Put it into the hands cuffed, and you're going to El Salvador.\n[2170.48] So let me just highlight the point that Holman made.\n[2172.72] He said, listen, if sanctuary cities didn't release these people back out of the public, we wouldn't have to go to Home Depot.\n[2178.00] Yeah.\n[2178.40] He said in the community.\n[2180.08] Which is a great choice of words.\n[2181.44] Yes, they put them right back out in the community.\n[2183.12] I believe the Los Angeles area is where they were doing the home depot stuff in California.\n[2186.56] Sanctuary state.\n[2187.44] By the way, two million illegals have been removed from the United States.\n[2190.16] That's either through the deportation orders or self-deportation, or as we refer to it, a happy side effect.\n[2195.52] Yes.\n[2195.92] I love that.\n[2196.32] I love the self-deportation.\n[2197.68] So do I.\n[2199.76] Get out.\n[2200.56] Thank you very much.\n[2201.60] The right to tackle anybody.\n[2202.72] Two million?\n[2203.28] That's a good start because 12 to 20 million came here illegally just in the years under Biden.\n[2208.56] 12 to 20 million.\n[2210.08] Two million is a good start.\n[2211.44] Let's pump up those numbers.\n[2212.80] Let's go back to, since it's not what you voted for.\n[2215.20] Uh Donald Trump then on uh crime, right?\n[2218.72] He and this is one thing that's really important because I was doing this change my mind, people saying, well, you have to acknowledge the rhetoric of Donald Trump.\n[2224.24] That's the reason for all this unrest.\n[2226.08] No, no, no, no.\n[2227.12] Donald Trump was elected the first time on Law and Order.\n[2231.28] Do you remember that?\n[2231.92] Remember that escalator ride?\n[2234.24] People were furious because he said they're not sending their best and their brightest.\n[2237.12] He was talking about MS 13.\n[2238.16] He was talking about gang members.\n[2239.36] You remember Donald Trump was elected.\n[2241.12] After that escalator ride, he delivered a speech discussing law and order because we'd already had Mike Brown.\n[2247.36] We'd already had Trayvon Martin.\n[2248.56] Hands up, don't shoot.\n[2249.84] You already had the Black Lives Matter riots starting.\n[2252.64] We'd already had, by the way, the assassination of Dallas police officers.\n[2256.56] Americans were getting tired of the lawlessness from the left.\n[2260.00] And that started under Barack Obama.\n[2262.64] You know, the great uniter.\n[2264.16] So this is Donald Trump then on crime.\n[2267.12] Mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime-free America.\n[2277.52] We want a crime-free America.\n[2280.00] We're going to stop violent crime in the United States.\n[2284.24] Okay, so if you if he turned out to be very soft on crime, that wouldn't be what you voted for.\n[2287.52] I'd be furious.\n[2288.16] But that brings us to President Trump now, taking every action humanly possible to stop the violent crime waves in leftist cities.\n[2296.00] This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington, DC.\n[2303.20] One day after President Trump announced his plan, National Guard troops were deployed to DC streets Tuesday night.\n[2309.52] President Trump is basically saying mission accomplished and signaling that his takeover of law enforcement in DC will soon spread to other cities.\n[2317.44] An executive order signed today directs the Pentagon to create specialized guard units in every state to deal with quote public order issues.\n[2325.84] President Donald Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to disperse protesters who were rising on the streets of Los Angeles.\n[2336.80] Portland is unbelievable what's going on in Portland.\n[2341.28] Uh the uh uh destruction of the city.\n[2348.88] Night after night, this is the scene just outside the ice facility in Portland.\n[2353.12] Hundreds of residents live in apartments just feet away.\n[2356.00] They routinely call police about the noise and crime.\n[2358.80] We're gonna do that in Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of hate insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago, too.\n[2368.80] There's no city in\n[2360.16] Chicago.\n[2360.64] We're gonna do that in Portland.\n[2362.16] Now, Portland is different.\n[2363.52] That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists.\n[2366.16] But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too.\n[2368.88] There's no city in the world like that.\n[2371.12] We're gonna straighten it out.\n[2372.88] Yep.\n[2373.44] That's what I voted for.\n[2374.64] Sounds tough on crime to me.\n[2375.76] He actually sent the National Guard to now we have a tally, DC, LA, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago.\n[2381.28] A good start.\n[2382.32] Let's go back to President Trump then on wars, right?\n[2387.12] He talked about ending, and this is something that's not new with President Trump.\n[2390.16] You guys, the only thing that we know about Donald Trump for decades now, on which he's been remarkably consistent, is that he's largely a non-interventionist.\n[2397.36] He's very anti-war.\n[2398.32] He's very anti-people dying, I should say.\n[2400.56] And he has always maintained that uh Iran should not get a nuke.\n[2403.28] This is going back to the early 2000s.\n[2404.64] We we usually don't have this kind of a track record uh of our presidents because they became public figures once they were elected to public office.\n[2411.52] Donald Trump was a celebrity before that.\n[2413.28] So you can see where he lined up.\n[2414.96] So President Trump then on ending international conflicts and needless foreign wars.\n[2420.64] I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\n[2427.12] Okay, so if he decided to engage in more wars in international conflict, I'd say, well, that's not what I voted for, which brings us to Donald Trump.\n[2435.20] Now, uh brokering a record number of peace deals in record time.\n[2439.84] Also, ceasefires.\n[2441.36] But it's a big beautiful honor to welcome everyone to the White House for this very historic piece of the city.\n[2450.08] Between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n[2452.96] Top military leaders from Pakistan and India will meet later today to discuss the next steps.\n[2457.92] After reaching a ceasefire this weekend, the U.S.\n[2460.80] brokered ceasefire seems to be holding for now.\n[2463.76] The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda.\n[2472.00] We have some major breaking news right now.\n[2473.52] President Donald Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire set to start in six hours.\n[2480.48] I'm pretty happy with that.\n[2481.92] Let me tell you because that's what I voted for, and I got mostly what it now nothing's perfect.\n[2486.16] But let's look at the the record number of peace deals or ceasefires or overall reduction in hostilities.\n[2491.36] I know because people try and sort of uh nickel and dime me on this.\n[2494.40] You can check the references.\n[2495.28] This these come from Washington uh inside, these come from the New York Times, these come from Reuters, AP, Axios, Wall Street Journal, ABC, not bastions of right-wing conservatism.\n[2504.24] So the ceasefires are the peace deals that have been brokered.\n[2506.72] Israel-Iran, India, Pakistan, Armenia, Izerbaijan, Cambodia, Thailand, Egypt, Ethiopia, Serbia, Kosovo, Congo, Rwanda, and possibly coming soon to a Jew theater near you, Israel and Gaza.\n[2519.76] Which brings us to sort of a bonus here is that uh, you know, President Trump is doing Israel's bidding, is what we just heard from people like uh, I guess The Ovan and a few others.\n[2528.88] Uh, here's the truth.\n[2530.08] No, he's he's really not.\n[2531.52] He's actually been, I would say, significantly harsher on Israel than even Democrat administrations, because what they say publicly is very different from um their rhetoric has been different from how they deal with Israel as a nation.\n[2544.24] So let's look at how Donald Trump has been dealing with Israel.\n[2546.72] I'm not happy that Israel's going out now.\n[2548.72] That's not what we want.\n[2549.68] I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that, Israel either.\n[2552.80] We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n[2560.08] Do you understand that?\n[2560.96] Best quotes of all time.\n[2562.08] Kids that are starving.\n[2565.20] That's I mean, they are starving.\n[2567.52] They gotta get them food.\n[2569.04] And we're gonna get them food.\n[2570.40] We had a phone call today just to make it clear.\n[2574.16] I said to uh the uh sorry, the prime minister of Qatar.\n[2579.52] Israel uh was targeting terrorists, wasn't targeting Qatar.\n[2583.20] And of course, we regretted the loss of the Qatari uh citizens.\n[2587.68] I love the context of that because Donald Trump was the one who basically told him to apologize for.\n[2590.80] Yes.\n[2591.12] He's like, go Qatar, say you're sorry.\n[2593.28] No, and mean it.\n[2595.36] I have to believe it, BB.\n[2599.04] This also comes from Axios.\n[2600.64] I don't know if this is true because Axios reports all kinds of crap that's not true.\n[2603.68] But allegedly Donald Trump told Netanyahu during some recent negotiations.\n[2607.52] I don't know why you're always so fucking negative.\n[2610.72] This is a win.\n[2611.76] Take it.\n[2612.80] Take it, baby.\n[2613.92] Take the win.\n[2614.56] Stop being so fucking negative.\n[2616.40] Learn a smile a lot.\n[2618.56] Yeah, I love it.\n[2619.44] Can you last a party dig it, brother?\n[2621.52] I don't think we ever heard anything from Barack Barack Obama that was close to that.\n[2624.88] Like, no, no, no, no, no, the Jews are fucking worry warps.\n[2628.00] Well, no, he Megatomances.\n[2629.92] He did tell Nat now not to get so wee weed up.\n[2632.40] No, no, don't get all weeweed up.\n[2634.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n[2637.36] Listen, I uh and this is this is one of the reasons that I think it's important to have the conversations we have on like claims like the Ovon made that we are working for Israel.\n[2647.28] Listen, you can think like we do that APAC shouldn't be buying both sides of our politicians.\n[2652.00] Of course, we shouldn't do stuff that is not in the interest of the United States at the behest of Israel.\n[2656.64] But you also would have to then say, well, if we're working for Israel, then we're not acting in our own interest at all.\n[2661.60] That's just not true.\n[2662.80] Right.\n[2663.12] And you can point that out historically, both in some of the wars that we've gotten in, even in the Middle East and Iraq.\n[2667.92] That was not at the behest of Israel.\n[2670.08] You can go back and fact check that if you would like.\n[2672.16] They were actually against us doing that because they wanted us to go to Iran.\n[2674.80] Yeah.\n[2675.44] Afterwards, they were like, fine, that's good.\n[2677.28] We could do that.\n[2678.08] But it matters because then people go, what is left to be an American?\n[2681.44] We're just working for Israel.\n[2682.64] That's a real problem because you're not dealing with reality.\n[2685.04] You're kind of straw manning.\n[2686.56] Well, there is a problem, but not that.\n[2688.56] Well, it is also odd to me when you have people saying, like, Israel and the way they're just awful in the violation of human rights and a genocide.\n[2693.92] And then you have so many comedians who are happy to go and perform for the Saudi Arabian government.\n[2699.52] Yes.\n[2700.16] Where there is now a comedy festival.\n[2701.92] It used to be like in Montreal.\n[2702.96] Oh, yeah, sorry, you had a clip.\n[2704.32] Yeah, they they did remind me that they wanted to show this entoncle.\n[2707.60] Yeah, so CNN just released a poll that kind of buttresses the point on whether Donald Trump is doing what he promised or not.\n[2713.20] Okay.\n[2713.92] Well, is Trump doing what he promised in the 2024 campaign?\n[2717.44] Yes, 52%, the majority of Americans.\n[2720.80] Donald Trump is doing what he promised compared to 48% who said no.\n[2724.48] So what essentially is going on here is the voters expected all of this from Donald Trump.\n[2729.04] The majority did, and that is why his favorite rating simply has not really moved all that much compared to where it was a year ago.\n[2737.28] Trump is basically doing what the American people thought that he was going to do.\n[2742.32] Indeed, if you look at the numbers, Trump has basically the steadiest favorable rating this much through a presidency of any president on record, and it's basically where he was a year ago, good enough to get him re-elected.\n[2754.56] Yeah.\n[2754.88] Jeez.\n[2755.36] And I will say this the people who hate Donald Trump, they hate him because he's doing exactly what he said he would do.\n[2760.08] The people who voted for him are by and large happy because, again, according to the polls, he's doing what he said he would do.\n[2765.52] It just feels kind of astro-turfed.\n[2767.60] It just feels pretty fake when the only people who are claiming, you know, it's I'm not getting what I voted for are people who are podcast hosts who were mostly liberal up until recently, which just happens to coincide with more clicks during this election time because Kamala Harris was like uh web traffic cancer.\n[2783.92] Yeah.\n[2784.88] That's gonna go down, by the way, as one uh if if not the worst, one of the worst picks for a presidential candidate.\n[2791.44] Yeah, absolutely.\n[2792.16] Did you see see her there at Howard University?\n[2793.84] I believe uh she was squashed out of her mind.\n[2797.20] Well, we'll we'll do that in uh Rumble Premium.\n[2798.80] We'll go over she's gonna be.\n[2801.52] Yeah.\n[2802.08] She's staying true to herself.\n[2803.52] Right.\n[2803.84] But the game didn't change her.\n[2805.20] Well, now they're having a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n[2807.60] I know you're thinking, oh, that's not a real thing.\n[2809.20] No, it is.\n[2809.76] Uh, in Riyadh.\n[2810.72] And before we get to the comedians taking part, uh, and why that might be a conflict of interest.\n[2816.24] We go first to our on-the-ground correspondent Thomas Finnegan, uh, who is at the Riyadh Festival to give us his thoughts on the event from the ground itself.\n[2832.16] All right, Finnegan, what are you seeing on the ground there?\n[2835.12] Hi, Stephen.\n[2835.92] Yeah, hi.\n[2836.56] So let me guess you took a wrong turn, something, something, yeah.\n[2840.56] No, I'm here.\n[2842.32] You mean you're at the right place at the right time?\n[2844.80] Of course.\n[2845.28] I always hit my marks.\n[2847.04] Did you get struck by lightning or something?\n[2848.96] I use comet web browser by perplexity AI.\n[2851.92] It booked my airline ticket, my hotel, and even my ride to the airport.\n[2856.08] And I have it getting me a reservation at Riadi Lobster later.\n[2859.52] And yes, once when I was 11, but I'd rather not talk about that.\n[2863.12] Is comet, you say?\n[2865.04] Comic?\n[2865.84] Yeah, just download it.\n[2866.64] You'll see what I'm talking about.\n[2868.64] You're finna get a high ready for you on their car.\n[2871.20] Can't you see I'm busy at work?\n[2873.28] Crying a lot.\n[2874.08] What the f is wrong with you?\n[2876.72] Okay, Tim, let's cut it, I think.\n[2878.48] Let's just get rid of uh Finnegan.\n[2880.00] But it's a good tip.\n[2882.32] Oh, your mother's actually you can download Perplexity AI's new web browser Comet uh and get a free month of Rumble Premium.\n[2896.88] If you did, go to PPLX.ai slash crowd or PPLX.ai slash crowd.\n[2901.52] That's right.\n[2901.84] They've partnered up with Rumble Premium.\n[2903.04] Yeah, they have.\n[2903.60] That's a pretty good uh pretty good bundle deal.\n[2905.36] It is.\n[2905.60] I think there's some cool features that maybe you get if you're a

on.\n[2923.68] They even released this teaser to give fans a taste of what to expect.\n[2940.00] Oh my god!\n[2942.16] Okay.\n[2942.80] Yeah.\n[2943.44] I was like, ah, this is doesn't that check out it checks out.\n[2946.32] All right.\n[2947.04] This doesn't feel real.\n[2948.32] Totally now it's real.\n[2949.60] Two drink minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these.\n[2950.16] Minimum at kabooms.\n[2952.08] Kaboom's comedy club in Saudi Arabia.\n[2954.56] Yeah, it's well with a K.\n[2955.60] Everything.\n[2956.24] KKK, Kabooms Comedy Club.\n[2958.40] Just to be clear, before we get to this and all these comedians who are, you know, comedians always want to, and this is why I've always like it's not a club that they act like they're changing the world.\n[2968.16] And I get it, by the way.\n[2969.20] Comedy is important to speak truth to power.\n[2971.28] I understand it.\n[2972.56] But a lot of people have cashed in on that uh while doing nothing more than cashing in on that.\n[2977.60] So let's set the stage here.\n[2979.28] We're talking whether it's Israel, and by the way, completely valid to criticize the Israeli government and certainly Netanyahu because he has an incentive to keep this war going on.\n[2987.36] As soon as it's done, he's out.\n[2988.88] I get that.\n[2989.76] I also understand criticizing the American government uh because they've fallen short in many ways.\n[2994.96] But to do so while running interference for the Saudis, that's where I go, oh, maybe you don't believe what you're saying necessarily, because their track record on human rights.\n[3004.56] Well, let me just give them to you.\n[3005.76] Saudi Arabia is number four on the top ten slave-owning countries in the world today.\n[3010.24] Wow.\n[3010.72] More slaves on earth today than ever in recorded history, by the way, over 50 million.\n[3014.16] They uh they administer the death penalty for things like being gay, apostasy, blasphemy against Islam.\n[3020.32] Apostasy, in their case means just basically leaving.\n[3022.72] Yes.\n[3023.04] You're a Muslim, now you're not.\n[3024.32] You get put to death.\n[3025.28] They've murdered journalists.\n[3026.72] Of course, you guys remember uh Kashagi, that was a big one.\n[3029.20] And of course, women were not allowed to drive until 2018.\n[3031.84] So they weren't all wrong.\n[3033.44] Traffic accidents went what went up a lot.\n[3035.76] Yeah.\n[3036.32] Now, performers at the festival.\n[3038.48] See if you can spot a trend here.\n[3039.92] Aziz Ansari, Wayne Brady, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Kevin Hart, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Lee, Andrew Santino, Andrew Schultz, Chris Tucker, Louis C.\n[3047.76] K.\n[3048.16] Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Manaskalco.\n[3050.64] And the contract stipulations, by the way, they were more lengthy when they started, and I guess they sort of reduced it down.\n[3055.76] Um they they basically stated that you you couldn't make fun of the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3060.48] You couldn't make fun of the royal family at all, and you couldn't make fun of religion.\n[3064.08] I well, I want to they probably could probably make fun of a couple of religions.\n[3068.56] I think that no religions.\n[3070.08] They probably said no religion because they just didn't want it, they didn't want the optics of saying you can't make fun of Islam.\n[3074.72] Right.\n[3075.04] So if they say, don't make fun of religion in general because it's disrespectful.\n[3078.56] Because we respect the Jews.\n[3080.64] Yes, exactly.\n[3081.76] I don't know.\n[3082.56] So but but think about this.\n[3084.24] You're a comedian, you're taking a check to go perform for what is effectively just they are a perpetual abuser of human rights, Saudi Arabia.\n[3093.44] And you can't make fun of them for well, how can you speak truth to power?\n[3096.16] It's baked into the contract.\n[3097.76] Right.\n[3098.08] Where you can't make fun of them.\n[3099.52] And some of the comedians were reportedly offered anywhere from 350,000 to 1.6 million dollars.\n[3106.32] Tim Dillon, who was disinvited, and uh I by the way, respect to him for uh ending up disinvited.\n[3112.96] He said that he was offered 375,000.\n[3115.84] 375,000.\n[3117.76] I think he even took uh down payment or something.\n[3119.76] He was joking about it.\n[3120.56] Maybe it was just a joke, but uh yeah, he did joke about it pretty hard.\n[3123.76] Yeah, I don't I don't know if he did or if he didn't.\n[3125.44] By the way, this is why we are funded by viewers like you, not a foreign caliphate.\n[3128.80] You can join, you can click that button join Rumble Premium.\n[3130.72] Mug Club is Rumble Premium uh Rumble Premium is Mug Club, and if not, let us earn your vote tomorrow.\n[3136.16] Uh but I would hate to find myself in a position where I have to take money from the Saudis.\n[3141.28] Okay, well then I'm gonna need to cancel that flight.\n[3143.20] No more.\n[3145.36] I do hear that uh uh was it uh at UAE Airlines United Arab Emirates Airlines that is that it's beautiful first club.\n[3151.12] Fantastic.\n[3151.44] Well, they're great.\n[3152.56] And the ladies still wear skirts, that's awesome.\n[3154.16] Yeah.\n[3154.40] Yeah, I do.\n[3155.12] The guys wear them too, but it's weird.\n[3156.16] I do like the old Pan Am outfits.\n[3157.92] So uh the comedians who will be going, Dave Chappelle, he said this about Riyadh.\n[3161.68] He said, right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk that you'll get canceled.\n[3166.16] I've never heard anyone say that.\n[3167.76] Uh it's easier to talk here, meaning Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3172.64] What?\n[3174.48] Wrong.\n[3175.12] Yeah, who's there?\n[3175.92] Jimmy Kimmel.\n[3176.88] Oh, on a second.\n[3177.52] Have you performed anywhere in America where um you were met with the stipulations can't make fun of anyone in the government, can't make fun of any elected officials, and can't make fun of religion at all?\n[3190.32] I I I I I I think that's exclusive to the Saudi Arabian government.\n[3193.76] By the way, no one says that you'll be canceled if you talk about Charlie Kirk.\n[3196.56] Is he conflating this idea of the left gleefully celebrating the assassination of an innocent man and spitting on memorials and desecrating vigils?\n[3205.60] Is he conflating that with talking about Charlie Kirk?\n[3208.16] Because it's literally a cottage industry right now where everyone is talking about Charlie Kirk, and everyone, every Tom Dick and Harry has a conspiracy theory.\n[3214.32] It's easier to talk here, Saudi Arabia than it is in America.\n[3217.60] Well, let's let's let's see.\n[3219.20] Are there some criticisms that you have lobbed here in the United States that would not be allowed in Saudi Arabia?\n[3225.84] For example, have you complained about those in power here or made fun of them, which you absolutely are well within your right and should do, but of course, would be barred from ever being discussed in Saudi Arabia.\n[3236.64] Roll it, Tim.\n[3237.76] The beginning of the monologue, I contextualize it because I feel like a lot of white Americans uh uh finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans.\n[3247.52] Chappelle said during a routine at the gala, I was the first guy on TV to say, give Trump a chance.\n[3253.20] I effed up.\n[3254.32] Sorry.\n[3254.96] The former comedy central star also said he completely disagreed with Trump's travel ban attempt, which targeted Muslims.\n[3261.44] Chappelle said of the executive order, I think that is way out of step with the way people feel in America.\n[3268.16] Now, can you imagine him just in Saudi Arabia?\n[3270.48] I hear.\n[3272.08] I don't let homos drive.\n[3275.20] Yeah, he's never come back.\n[3276.96] He would never be allowed back.\n[3278.24] No.\n[3278.96] And that's the issue here is for me.\n[3281.12] Look, you want to take the money, that's fine.\n[3282.88] Just say, eh, it was a good check.\n[3284.00] We'll get to Pete Davidson in a bit because he was honest about it.\n[3286.32] But saying that it's easier to talk in Saudi Arabia when you are on record saying things about this administration, about this government that you would but by the contract stipulations.\n[3297.36] You would never be able to say there.\n[3299.52] That's dishonest.\n[3300.64] It's disingenuous.\n[3302.16] And um, I think would be an asterisk next to your name as a truth teller.\n[3306.56] The next one, I don't know if we have this clip.\n[3308.08] You said there was a V2 that you're waiting on, right?\n[3310.48] I didn't get it yet.\n[3311.28] Um, do we just have version one?\n[3313.52] No.\n[3314.48] You don't have any of them?\n[3315.44] I don't have any of that clip.\n[3316.24] Well, it'd be one thing if you'll come back to it.\n[3318.08] It'd be one thing if Chappelle had gone over there and he actually did, you know, talk about the royal family and talk about Islam or anything like that.\n[3324.24] And came back and was like, hey, yeah, I could say whatever I want, but he didn't do that.\n[3329.36] No, you didn't do that.\n[3330.16] He didn't do that.\n[3331.52] That brings us to uh, okay, let's do Louis C.\n[3333.20] K.\n[3333.44] Then So Louis C.\n[3335.04] K.\n[3335.52] defended his appearance in Riyadh.\n[3337.36] And again, the the issue here is just them turning themselves, just twisting themselves into pretzels to defend what they would refer to rightfully so as an authoritarian administration if any of their policies made their way over here while then lamenting the loss of our basic fundamental rights in the United States.\n[3354.24] Let's see Louis C.K.\n[3355.60] defending what's going on in Riyadh.\n[3357.20] And when this came up, uh they they said there's only two restrictions.\n[3361.52] It's the their their religion and their government.\n[3364.48] I don't have jokes about those two things.\n[3366.48] It used to be when you got when I got offers from places like that, that'd be long list, and I just say no, I don't need that.\n[3373.52] But when I heard its opening, I thought that's awfully interesting.\n[3376.56] That just feels like a good opportunity.\n[3378.64] And I just think comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.\n[3383.44] There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it, but I think for me it cuts towards going.\n[3388.56] And that's my that's my decision.\n[3390.56] And that's I know where it's coming from because I can see right inside myself.\n[3394.00] Right.\n[3395.12] Okay.\n[3395.68] Um let me distill this.\n[3397.52] How many of these people would have performed at a Donald Trump inauguration?\n[3403.52] Comment alone.\n[3404.40] How many do you think?\n[3405.12] The answer, of course, is none.\n[3406.32] Nobody.\n[3406.96] They criticize uh artists for performing.\n[3409.12] Right.\n[3409.28] And here's a thing.\n[3410.80] Yeah.\n[3411.12] They basically are.\n[3412.56] They basically are performing at a political event there because they're politically whitewashing Saudi Arabia.\n[3418.56] They have agreed we will not criticize those in power here so long as the checks cash.\n[3422.88] How many of them would perform at a Donald Trump inauguration or gridiron dinner?\n[3427.04] Yeah.\n[3427.60] Probably none.\n[3428.24] Here's Louis C.K.\n[3429.68] Uh addressing Donald Trump.\n[3431.76] Just picture Donald Trump as, you know, a royal Saudi.\n[3434.80] Then there's somebody who lies once in a while.\n[3436.64] It can't quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right?\n[3439.28] Somebody who lies sometimes.\n[3441.04] Then you have a liar, who's somebody who's almost like a to like a problem.\n[3445.28] They can't, you know, they can't help it.\n[3446.56] They lie a lot.\n[3447.36] Then you have just lion sack.\n[3450.48] And that's somebody who just lie.\n[3454.88] They like it.\n[3455.76] He likes it.\n[3456.64] He like he goes, it wasn't even true.\n[3459.60] Wasn't even true.\n[3460.88] And then I said they were liars.\n[3462.72] And we bombed a bunch of weddings in Yemen.\n[3464.80] We sent them like a present.\n[3466.24] Like they registered for a drone or something.\n[3468.72] Yeah.\n[3469.04] At every wedding there.\n[3469.92] So yeah, you didn't like that that much, did it?\n[3472.08] Also, that was effectively Saudi Arabia's war.\n[3474.32] Yes, that's true.\n[3476.48] That's a twofer.\n[3480.40] So you can blame Donald Trump for basically a Saudi Arabian conflict.\n[3484.96] And then say, but you know, it's a com it's a great way to get people talking.\n[3489.12] They're doing good.\n[3490.16] What?\n[3490.48] What?\n[3491.36] Okay, let's go to I guess he must have been okay with the drone attacks in Yemen two years prior.\n[3495.20] Yeah, I got I guess so.\n[3497.20] Let's go to Bill Burr.\n[3498.32] Bill Burr, of course, a beacon of truth telling, you know, as bold as they get, and by that I mean a guy who lifted Nick DePalo's act while he was watching him in Boston and was lost in tall weeds, largely an observational comic, who took Nick DePalo's shtick and then decided to soften it for the mainstream.\n[3510.32] Here's Bill Burr talking about performing in Saudi Arabia and how wonderful of an experience it was.\n[3515.68] The Royals loved the show.\n[3517.60] Everyone was happy.\n[3518.80] The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.\n[3521.12] Thank God.\n[3522.00] And uh yeah, it was just this great positive thing.\n[3527.04] And I gotta tell you, just to be a part of that was was it was fucking amazing.\n[3532.08] And the comedians that I've been talking to just wanted it.\n[3536.08] They wanted that.\n[3536.64] They wanted you to like the people want like you know, they go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.32] So they got you instead.\n[3548.72] It was a mind.\n[3540.00] They go online and they see it.\n[3541.20] They want to, they, you know, they want to like see real stand-up comedy.\n[3546.24] So they got you instead.\n[3548.80] It was a mind-blowing experience.\n[3551.68] Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.\n[3557.12] Look, there's nothing wrong with doing common.\n[3559.28] If you want to go and ask them, you know, talk about the microwave dinners on the airline or whatever it is.\n[3563.28] Okay.\n[3564.64] The four so flipsy.\n[3566.64] Yeah.\n[3566.96] To act like you're like, if it was the Bill Burr of York, you'd be like, right, really, dude.\n[3572.08] Like, we're not gonna act like only three years ago your women were allowed to drive.\n[3575.76] Right.\n[3576.16] Like, I get it's a positive impact.\n[3577.84] It's a change, but dude, come on.\n[3579.68] Like, your women are dressed like ninjas, right?\n[3582.80] They can't do it if you're throwing gaze off rooftops.\n[3585.12] It's been right in med for like a fucking week, right?\n[3587.68] Like, instead, he's like, Oh, this is great, man.\n[3589.84] It was fantastic.\n[3590.64] Let's go to the he also had some pretty nice insight as to um some of your misconceptions about Saudi Arabia.\n[3597.28] My whole fing idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen, like on the news.\n[3602.72] I've literally think I'm gonna fing land, you know, and everybody's gonna be screaming, death to America, and they're gonna have like fing machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?\n[3611.52] Because this is what I've been fed about that part of the world, right?\n[3615.84] And this is why it's so easy for the left to uh maintain zero principles.\n[3620.32] They straw man everything.\n[3621.92] Yeah.\n[3622.48] Like I would never, and by the way, I have a problem with any type of caliphate.\n[3626.72] I have a problem with any type of government that is largely predicated around Islam.\n[3630.48] Because I know what it actually stands for, but I wouldn't think for a second that if I landed, it would be a bunch of people shouting death to America.\n[3637.12] After they paid you to fly there?\n[3638.80] Exactly.\n[3639.36] Right, right.\n[3639.92] No, but but like since he goes, and since it wasn't that way, it's actually not what you think.\n[3644.24] Yeah, and then he's straw man's Donald Trump voter.\n[3646.08] He's straw man's Donald Trump himself.\n[3647.76] So basically, you're your your your principles can just shape shift.\n[3651.20] By the way, just to be clear, I would never be able to perform Henry Add.\n[3654.80] I would guaranteed be executed.\n[3656.16] Do you know that?\n[3657.36] Guaranteed be executed if I should if I landed, set foot in Saudi Arabia.\n[3662.00] They could go through my YouTube channel, they could pick five videos from 2008 through 2012.\n[3668.16] Go back into the catalog and go, oh, well, of course we have to kill him.\n[3671.84] So I forgive me if I don't have a lot of love loss for these people.\n[3675.12] And here's Bill Burr.\n[3676.48] Again, just picture the criticism toward American officials and largely conservative.\n[3681.84] Just picture them as the Saudi royal family.\n[3684.08] Here he is.\n[3684.88] That idiot Elon Musk.\n[3687.20] Oh.\n[3687.76] That guy, like he's gonna leave who evidently is a Nazi.\n[3691.28] Like, I just refuse to believe that it was an accidental two times Seagil.\n[3694.96] Why do you think people are still in the clamp?\n[3697.52] 2024.\n[3698.48] Some guy yelled out, he goes, something to do.\n[3700.80] The reason why they they they still fing exist is because they don't fk with white people.\n[3705.44] That's basically it.\n[3706.56] If they did the if they did the white people, what the f they've done to black people, how long do you think that stupid fing group would have been around?\n[3713.04] These fing billionaires.\n[3715.68] They they they need to be put down.\n[3718.64] You know, like fing rabid dogs.\n[3721.44] They're like rabid with fing greed and just going out and just dividing everybody.\n[3726.96] You know what I mean?\n[3727.76] Because some corporate c had to give himself a fing bonus check at the end of the year.\n[3732.48] What if we made it worse?\n[3735.12] But made it look the same.\n[3736.80] Yeah.\n[3737.20] Then could our pools be bigger?\n[3739.28] Free Luigi.\n[3740.40] But CNN and Fox News are not gonna bring up the insurance companies that are just gonna keep everybody's premiums and still give themselves a bonus.\n[3747.68] Yes!\n[3749.20] Free Luigi!\n[3750.64] Kind of like the royal family worth 1.4 trillion?\n[3752.96] Right.\n[3753.28] If you want to join a younger hipper white nationalist group, right?\n[3757.52] Like the neo-Nazis or the Proud Boys, you know, with their little fades, you know, and they look cookie dope.\n[3763.84] Whatever the secret handshake is.\n[3765.28] I'm looking out my white head watching this white shit.\n[3768.48] It's coming back into my white eyes getting whiter by the fing second.\n[3773.20] Right?\n[3774.24] Now my wife, on the other hand, she's black, right?\n[3777.60] You guys stood by us toxic white males through centuries of our crimes against humanity?\n[3784.00] You rolled around in the blood money, and occasionally when you wanted to sneak off and hook up with the black dude, if you got caught, you said it wasn't consensual.\n[3792.16] Oh, you could be the support the troops, you know, America love it or leave it, and then this guy comes in and gives a shout out to Hitler.\n[3799.68] Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?\n[3801.76] You knew when he was like protesting during the national anthem, no one was gonna listen to what the f he had to say, no matter how much he explained it.\n[3808.80] And we don't want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.\n[3811.52] What would be the sense of making it illegal?\n[3813.68] Oh, that's really gonna stop Putin.\n[3815.44] No, to stop people from going to war, you have to also put boots.\n[3819.68] You can't sit down and talk it out.\n[3821.28] Do a podcast.\n[3821.84] Why can't Putin do a podcast with the head guy?\n[3825.04] Like you just solved the Middle East on a podcast.\n[3827.44] Why can't they solve what they're doing on a podcast?\n[3830.24] This is why this is not yours.\n[3832.96] One guess.\n[3834.72] Let's talk about the the crimes against humanity, right?\n[3837.28] Like, like slavery where you just performed and it still exists now.\n[3841.84] They have slaves.\n[3842.96] I'm glad they had a chilies, Bill.\n[3846.00] They also have slaves.\n[3848.96] And we're gonna continue talking about this, by the way.\n[3850.80] If you're not a Rumble Premier member, click that button.\n[3852.80] Um, and you can continue with us.\n[3854.48] We're gonna be taking some of your chat, probably, probably a lot of questions about the food poisoning.\n[3857.76] I do appreciate when someone says, you know what, my principles don't mean all that much to me, and uh uh I was just willing to take the money because hey, it's a good check.\n[3865.28] And that is pretty much exactly what Pete Davidson said.\n[3868.96] And I will tell you, I respect him more than the Bill Burrs and the Louis C.\n[3872.64] K's of the world for being honest.\n[3874.24] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you get that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3882.64] Right.\n[3883.04] You know, and that they can say that.\n[3970.96] But no, what I've heard, dude, is that that Riyadh festival is that you that they're they're like, you know, there's a lot of people that say people are getting paid by this Middle Eastern money.\n[3979.44] Right.\n[3979.84] You know, and that they can say this or they can't say that, or that they're over there, they're gonna try to influence you guys in order to speak certain ways.\n[3987.04] Do you are you part of that conspiracy theory, or is that nothing you're on?\n[3990.40] I I've heard there's subreddits of like, I think all these people are in bed with that.\n[3997.20] Um I just, you know, I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I'll go.\n[4003.12] Yeah, you know, and also I appreciate it.\n[4007.36] There's there's part of me that's just like, you know, I've been getting a little bit of uh flack just because like my dad died 9-11, so they're they're like, how could you possibly go there?\n[4017.76] At least he's honest.\n[4018.64] Yeah.\n[4018.96] He's not he's not presenting himself as a champion of of truth telling.\n[4022.96] No.\n[4023.36] And then someone who is as blunt as possible, and I again I really appreciate this.\n[4026.48] Going one step further.\n[4027.28] Shane Gillis said that uh he definitely could not perform there in Saudi Arabia.\n[4031.92] I'll be honest, I don't really, I don't really have strong feelings about the uh Saudi Arabia Comedy Festival.\n[4036.56] I do get the fact that they perpetrated non-I'm not doing it.\n[4041.20] That is good.\n[4041.84] I I admire that.\n[4042.96] Then they doubled the bag, and I was like, sorry, just go and Google who really did 9-11.\n[4051.76] Okay, fine, never mind.\n[4055.36] They doubled the bag, the princes.\n[4058.64] It was a significant bag.\n[4060.56] What?\n[4061.44] Yeah, but I'd already said no.\n[4064.08] You know?\n[4064.72] I took a principled stand.\n[4066.32] Yeah, against Saudi Arabia.\n[4067.52] It wasn't even that.\n[4068.08] I didn't even think about it.\n[4068.80] I thought we were allies with Saudi Arabia.\n[4070.56] Yeah, we are.\n[4071.04] We give them a ton of sh.\n[4073.76] So why the hell they do 9-11 to us.\n[4075.92] We're a boys.\n[4076.72] I think wasn't Osama Beladen just from Saudi Arabia.\n[4080.00] Really?\n[4080.72] All the hijackers.\n[4082.24] Every single hijacker, basically.\n[4083.44] Yeah.\n[4083.76] Saudi.\n[4084.88] Yeah, you don't 9-11 your friends, bro.\n[4087.92] You don't.\n[4090.80] Great reaction.\n[4091.60] I like that they counter-offered, you know.\n[4093.20] I didn't get any offer.\n[4094.16] I actually auditioned for it.\n[4095.36] Did you?\n[4095.68] How'd it go?\n[4096.24] Yeah, well, I'm not good.\n[4097.36] They said that uh they said it was a little too derivative of Sebastian Manuscalco who's already there, but I think it was because of my speech.\n[4103.60] Oh.\n[4104.40] I wish I knew how to do it.\n[4106.24] I do.\n[4106.88] I wish I knew.\n[4107.92] And there's guys in here right now.\n[4109.60] They know how to stone a woman.\n[4111.84] I got buddies like this.\n[4113.76] They stone, they they stone a woman on the weekend.\n[4117.84] I come over to the house and they're like, hey, you want to see the woman I stoned in the backyard?\n[4122.56] And I'm like, you stoned a woman?\n[4125.20] When?\n[4126.08] Today.\n[4126.96] Today?\n[4128.00] I took a nap today.\n[4129.76] You stoned the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this?\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post.\n[4130.16] Stone the whole woman to death.\n[4132.96] You know, guys like this.\n[4134.48] They got a flatbed Toyota Hilux, 8K 47s, a stoning post in the backyard, a lot of stones everywhere.\n[4143.12] I don't got any of that.\n[4144.32] I gotta hire a contractor.\n[4147.68] You know, I think I might have had a point.\n[4149.28] I don't think that was so much of a principled thing.\n[4152.08] I mean, just I don't think I was just like Sebastian.\n[4155.92] No, I just I could also understand why, you know, they might not want you and like side by side.\n[4160.24] There's a resemblance.\n[4160.88] Yeah, yeah, there's a resemblance.\n[4162.00] In the end.\n[4162.56] Well, we both like a lot of leather.\n[4164.16] Yes.\n[4164.64] That's right.\n[4166.24] Both Italian guys from Chicago.\n[4168.08] From Chicago.\n[4168.56] Yeah.\n[4168.72] Yeah.\n[4168.88] That's basically you two and things used to be better.\n[4171.20] Okay.\n[4171.76] Just uh, you know, maybe let it go.\n[4173.36] It's you two and Dennis Farina.\n[4174.72] Yeah.\n[4175.12] I don't know you know who that is.\n[4176.16] Oh, he's the best.\n[4176.80] He's the he's the best Chicago accent guy ever.\n[4179.20] What were you gonna say that?\n[4180.32] So I was gonna say something just hit me and it kind of occurred to me in this.\n[4183.60] You know, they they're talking about like hey, I think people are being paid to go over there and come back kind of as ambassadors, right?\n[4188.32] And that makes sense because you know, Saudi Arabia's gonna pay you to go over there.\n[4191.20] They they've had these world championships for you know, wrestling, grappling, whatever, all these different things over there.\n[4196.40] They've they've bought the you know, WWE is owned by Saudi Arabia now.\n[4200.56] Well, they've they've bought into a lot of Saudi Premier League clubs and they bought some of the best players in the world to have them come over in the ambassador, some of the most influential like online personalities ever.\n[4209.60] Ronaldo's one of those guys, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n[4212.80] So it's okay to do that.\n[4215.20] Correct.\n[4215.84] But if you get paid to go to Israel and go see the holy sites by Netanyahu and all these guys, it's not okay.\n[4222.32] And I'm not defending doing that, because I don't like that either.\n[4224.48] But I'm saying, how can you look at one and go, Saudi Arabia's fine when the left was absolutely going after Donald Trump every single frickin' day when he went to Saudi Arabia and they received him like a king, and he was basically saying, like, I cannot believe we're going over to the Where are your principles?\n[4240.64] Left, not just these comedians.\n[4242.08] Don't exist.\n[4242.72] The left.\n[4243.52] This is the exact same scenario, and I disagree with both.\n[4247.12] But not the left.\n[4247.92] They only hate one.\n[4248.96] And it really is funny because I thought you hated the other country too.\n[4252.24] Until it turns out that it's just not the Jews in that country.\n[4255.36] That's the only variable that I see that's different.\n[4257.44] Maybe just give me some more information and tell me how I uh misunderstood.\n[4261.36] Just to be a little bit of a devil's advocate here, as somebody who's in the comedy world, they are getting a lot of flack from the left.\n[4268.00] Yeah, they are.\n[4268.40] That is they're getting it from both sides.\n[4272.80] Yeah, they actually politicians.\n[4274.56] Politicians, I don't know.\n[4275.76] They're not politicians, but from left in comedy.\n[4277.68] And the leftist people and and people in comedy, it they have they have really burned uh the bridge from both ends here.\n[4284.88] Yeah.\n[4288.00] It's yeah.\n[4289.44] Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the people who did it are the people who are like, I'm not really I'm a classical liberal.\n[4293.36] A lot of people who showed up to speak are the people who sit on that fence.\n[4296.32] You know, the the outwardly left comedians have criticized them, and then of course people on the right have criticized him.\n[4300.88] It's a lot of the people who claim to be the news to part of the new right, the eight elements of the world who uh these people go and try and make it seem like they're taking a principled stand.\n[4309.20] Speaking of not understanding, Kamala Harris.\n[4311.60] Oh boy.\n[4312.08] Uh she was it Howard Unit?\n[4313.44] Was I right?\n[4313.76] Or is it Howard University?\n[4314.88] Um Is that an HBCU want to take some shots?\n[4317.68] I well that's pretty much every university to Kamala Harris because she showed up and see if you can spot how drunk she is.\n[4325.04] I am so proud of all the people how how to mind it.\n[4332.40] Just the start.\n[4333.20] Because she does gather herself and then she speaks semi-articulately, but right?\n[4336.08] This is like she's stumbling, first off.\n[4338.40] Yeah.\n[4338.96] I'm so how out wait, wait, wait, wait.\n[4342.40] I'm so wait.\n[4344.64] I'm so proud.\n[4345.44] Yeah, I think the drunk lady at the bar is like, you know what the problem with the uh wait.\n[4351.04] Sorry.\n[4351.60] Hold on.\n[4352.16] Okay.\n[4352.88] You know what the problem?\n[4354.00] Yes, exactly.\n[4355.76] Play it again from the beginning because she looks drunk as right there at the beginning.\n[4359.44] I am so proud of all of you.\n[4365.04] I feel to have been educated at Howard University.\n[4368.96] There is so much about everything I have achieved, and I've been the first to do many things because it's here when I was.\n[4376.80] First to blow a mayor for an unelected position.\n[4379.60] That everything that I'm being told and feel tells us we can be and do anything that we expect you to be leaders.\n[4391.04] The drunk muppet.\n[4392.08] Statewide, nationally, and internationally.\n[4394.48] And especially at this period of time, I want that you all know our country and our world needs you all.\n[4402.32] We need you.\n[4403.52] So you be strong, you feed these big brains of yours.\n[4411.52] She's clearly drunk.\n[4412.72] And enjoy this.\n[4414.64] And know how special you are, and how much we need you.\n[4418.72] That's what I want for you.\n[4420.48] That's what I need from you.\n[4422.08] All right.\n[4425.84] By the way, that Secret Service guy, you know, is like he put in his time, he joined, he went through the training and then got Kamala Harris's teacher.\n[4432.56] I know.\n[4433.44] All of that was nothing, too.\n[4434.80] She said nothing.\n[4435.60] No.\n[4437.20] Also, she has the uh the drunk lady pointing finger.\n[4439.60] Yeah, she does.\n[4440.24] Where it's like pointing is like this, but like drunk ladies, they point like this.\n[4443.44] Yeah.\n[4445.12] It could be you down there.\n[4447.36] Yeah.\n[4448.24] I take a what do you have back there behind the bar?\n[4452.16] Yeah, the Hennessy.\n[4453.92] Yeah.\n[4454.16] Not the top shelf.\n[4456.56] Not in the not the well in the middle.\n[4459.12] You put it right here in my cup.\n[4460.64] It's over over here.\n[4462.00] I can make a sound of a faucet.\n[4463.76] What?\n[4467.68] Who wants to see my tits?\n[4471.60] Nobody.\n[4475.20] Here's what what stuck out to me when I watched it, I was going, wow.\n[4478.72] Who was running the country for four years?\n[4480.88] Because it wasn't Joe Biden.\n[4481.84] We all know that.\n[4482.40] But then you no one on the ticket was making any decisions of consequence.\n[4487.04] He is basically an invalid.\n[4488.48] And I don't say that to make fun of him.\n[4489.76] I say it because it's true.\n[4490.88] And she's a drunk.\n[4492.08] Yes.\n[4492.64] There's no way that they were even they they were deliberately kept away from consequential business.\n[4497.28] Oh, that was by committee.\n[4498.32] That was a cabinet presidency.\n[4500.00] It really was.\n[4500.56] Yeah.\n[4500.88] I mean, if if we had a a real real investigation into what was going on, it would actually turn out that Donald Trump is right by putting the auto pen on the wall as the previous one.\n[4510.88] Which I'm sure he'll replace when he leaves.\n[4512.64] Yeah.\n[4513.28] But do you do you think this is a crazy hype hypothetical?\n[4516.16] Do you think that if uh Joe Biden had had all his faculties about him and he was, you know, competent in everything he was doing, do you think it would have been a better four years?\n[4525.68] Do you think you would have had the flood of immigrants?\n[4527.76] Do you think you don't think so?\n[4529.20] I don't think it would have been any better.\n[4530.32] Okay.\n[4530.88] I think he's an unprincipled man.\n[4532.08] I mean, you can just see his flip-flops and the fact that he's only ever suckled at the at the government teeth.\n[4537.20] Yeah.\n[4537.60] He's never.\n[4538.64] Yeah, for sure.\n[4539.04] No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n[4539.84] He served his country his entire life selflessly, Steven.\n[4542.56] Let me correct you.\n[4543.36] So I think he's the kind of guy who no matter what would pull the room and go, what do you think?\n[4546.32] What do you think of sound good?\n[4547.52] Oh, gonna do that.\n[4548.48] No matter what.\n[4549.60] Um he didn't have any wise counsel.\n[4551.92] Wise advisor.\n[4552.64] I mean, his closest advisor would be Miss Drunklush.\n[4556.24] It's Or his wife.\n[4557.60] Yeah.\n[4558.16] You answered all the questions.\n[4559.52] And she's Satan.\n[4560.32] He chose her in the first place.\n[4562.16] I mean, she is the DEI VP pick.\n[4564.64] This person didn't even make it to the calendar year of the actual election when she was running to be the nominee.\n[4570.48] Didn't I think was polling less than one percent?\n[4573.52] Didn't even win California, her own state.\n[4575.28] I was about to say, there's no logical reason to pick Kamala Harris.\n[4579.76] Just like there was no logical reason for Kamala Harris not to pick Shapiro from Pennsylvania, other than he was Jewish.\n[4585.52] The Democrat Democrats really, it's very obvious that they pick very weak VP candidates.\n[4589.76] Yeah.\n[4590.16] And when they could have they could have potentially won having picked Shapiro.\n[4593.68] I mean, that there was there was a whole people saying that that may have swung Pennsylvania, and that would have made it really hard for President Trump to win, and they won't make the obvious good decision, but they'll make the well, I know that this will buy me some votes in a community that I want to vote for me.\n[4605.04] It's not gonna give me California.\n[4606.08] I'm already getting that.\n[4606.96] Certainly she's gonna be.\n[4607.60] I mean, go back to Barack Obama.\n[4608.88] Look, he he picked Joe Biden as his nephew.\n[4611.28] They pick weak VP candidates.\n[4613.04] Yeah.\n[4613.28] That is he picked Joe Biden because he was kind of racist.\n[4616.16] Yeah.\n[4616.48] That's why he picked him.\n[4617.44] Joe Biden was a good idea.\n[4618.32] You know the first uh articulate young black guy who's clean artificial.\n[4621.68] Clean, articulate, and Brockman's like, oh, that's the guy I'll pick up my ticket.\n[4625.52] He talks to country folk like I know there are still some racist blue dog democrats.\n[4629.44] They'll vote for Joe.\n[4631.12] Picked him, and then Joe picked Kamala Harris.\n[4633.84] He's like, she likes to have a drink.\n[4635.60] You remember when that was it?\n[4636.64] That was a qualification.\n[4637.44] Obama came back to the White House and completely ignored Joe Biden.\n[4640.80] He's like, I was like, Brah!\n[4642.96] Bruh!\n[4643.76] And he's just over here shaking hands with people.\n[4645.52] He's like hitting him on the shoulder and nobody's paying attention to the president.\n[4648.48] It was so bad.\n[4649.60] It was sad.\n[4650.16] It was sad.\n[4650.72] When people say, you know, we're remember when the left was trying to sell us that we're respected on the world stage again with Joe Biden.\n[4655.60] It's like, come on.\n[4656.64] I don't even know what's going on with Carney right now, but I guarantee you that Donald Trump's bitch slapped him a time or two.\n[4661.28] Just since they've been together.\n[4663.60] Oh, that's fine.\n[4664.32] I didn't know that.\n[4664.80] I didn't know that was going on this morning.\n[4666.00] Look at his eyes.\n[4666.64] He's not happy.\n[4667.68] The tariffs are a big factor.\n[4669.84] And uh again, we'd be able to do great.\n[4673.04] Yeah.\n[4673.68] But you know, there's a point at which we also want the same business.\n[4677.52] We're competing for the same business.\n[4679.68] That's the problem.\n[4680.56] That's why I keep mentioning one way to solve that problem is a very easy way.\n[4685.04] But we're competing for the same business.\n[4687.36] Who wants to make ours?\n[4688.32] We want to make cars.\n[4689.36] And we're in competition.\n[4691.28] And the advantage we have is we have this massive market.\n[4694.56] So it's a you know, it's quite an advantage.\n[4699.44] Oh, I must be spicy.\n[4701.52] I've never heard that.\n[4704.08] Mr.\n[4704.40] President, can we talk about Bartman for a second?\n[4706.56] Are you planning to invoke the insurrection act?\n[4709.52] And that would be uh, you know, a very uh long standing war of law that's been on the book.\n[4715.68] Yeah, well, it's been invoked before, as you know.\n[4718.16] Uh if you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.28] Uh they lose they probably had.\n[4720.16] Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime.\n[4722.96] And if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.\n[4725.68] It's all very simple.\n[4727.92] They lose they probably had 50 murders in Chicago over the last uh five, six, seven months.\n[4736.16] Many people were shot.\n[4737.68] And then the governor gets up and he says, Well, we can handle it.\n[4740.32] They can't handle it.\n[4741.04] They don't know what they're doing.\n[4742.40] The mayor is grossly incompetent.\n[4744.16] He's at a four percent approval rating in Chicago.\n[4747.44] He's at a four percent lowest approval rating, lower than even De Blasio had, which is hard to believe in New York.\n[4754.00] I thought De Blasio would always maintain that record, but the Chicago guy is even lower.\n[4758.88] So I think that's so petty.\n[4762.32] We want safe cities.\n[4763.92] If you look at DC, you would right now, Mark, you could go out, take your family out to dinner, you could walk right down the middle of the street.\n[4771.44] There is no crime in DC.\n[4775.12] When I got here, this place was a raging hellhole.\n[4779.60] People would come from Canada, people would come from other places.\n[4782.40] Steven had raging hellhole this weekend.\n[4785.36] That's different.\n[4786.64] The National Guardsman, unbelievable.\n[4789.68] I mean, they are strong, tough guys.\n[4792.00] You know, we won something at the Supreme Court, which is a big deal.\n[4795.28] Merit.\n[4796.00] Everything now in this country is merit-based.\n[4798.32] I didn't think I'd ever see it again.\n[4800.48] And we have our soldiers and merit base too.\n[4803.20] And they're central casting.\n[4804.56] And they walk through that town, and I'll tell you what, this place is safe.\n[4808.32] It's beautiful.\n[4809.04] Mark, we'll send them to you.\n[4810.00] We'll walk through your towns.\n[4812.32] I think the question was about Portland.\n[4813.44] Yes, it was.\n[4816.72] And we're removing many people.\n[4818.72] In uh DC, we we took out 17 1,700 career criminals and sent them back to the countries from which they came, mostly led out by Biden and his people that had open border and open border policy.\n[4833.60] And you know, Canada, you suffered because of that too, because they'd come here and they'd go into Canada also.\n[4840.24] So we're like a buffer for that in terms of Canada suffered greatly by Biden and the open border, the policy of open border, totally unchecked, totally unvetted.\n[4852.00] And these people were.\n[4858.40] Yeah, he's really dealing with the Canada.\n[4861.44] And now I just like, yeah, no, that's a good point, Donald Trump.\n[4865.04] Whatever you say.\n[4865.84] Yes, sir.\n[4867.28] For four months.\n[4868.16] I don't even know if this is possible, but they this is the the figures were released.\n[4872.48] Zero people were able to come into the United States from the southern border.\n[4876.88] Zero.\n[4877.92] And as you know, we've we've taken a very hard stand on drugs.\n[4880.88] This is the same thing.\n[4881.44] This is one question.\n[4882.48] It was about Port Portland Portland.\n[4884.88] We call them the list of the Chapo.\n[4888.00] Alright.\n[4888.80] Chapo, I heard that.\n[4890.64] Frankly, there are no fishing boats.\n[4892.00] There's no boats out there, period.\n[4893.60] If you want to know the truth, we're saying does anybody go fishing anymore?\n[4900.40] Probably saying that less than a lot of people.\n[4901.60] So derailes, Canadian lives.\n[4906.56] I'm more of a salmon guy, though.\n[4908.80] It's uh and now they don't come in that way anymore.\n[4911.76] Now they'll come in other ways, and we're not going to allow that either.\n[4915.04] Next question.\n[4915.68] So we've done we've done a great job.\n[4917.36] I've said Portland.\n[4918.72] But uh on crime, Chicago is a great city, but you can't be a great city if you have murders and if you have a lot of problems, and they do.\n[4927.52] And they have an incompetent policy, just like they had open border policy.\n[4931.68] Anybody could come in.\n[4932.88] They came in from prisons, they came in from mental institutions, drug dealers, they came to the all over the place.\n[4939.44] And we don't have that anymore.\n[4941.68] This country is becoming very we're a very strong country.\n[4945.52] Look, financially speaking, I would say that because of the tariffs, because of the election, because of the policy, because of the great big beautiful deal.\n[4953.92] That's what I added the word great country.\n[4961.12] We don't need it.\n[4962.96] I've got to go.\n[4963.52] Uh take care of my mom.\n[4964.48] She's in hospice.\n[4965.44] Your mom's great.\n[4966.32] Look, funny story about your mom.\n[4967.84] When I was young, your mom she baked the best sugar cookies.\n[4971.68] I don't even like sugar cookies because all it is is is just sugar.\n[4975.28] There's no chocolate chips.\n[4976.96] There's no but she would do something special.\n[4979.28] I don't know what she did.\n[4980.16] Those cookies were special.\n[4981.36] Your mom's a very special lady.\n[4982.88] Okay, I got I gotta go uh one night under the moonlight in a full cornfield, your mom and I.\n[4988.40] Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're allowed our passion to get the better of us that night in Iowa for the go.\n[4997.92] It was a straw poll.\n[4999.20] She climbed my pole.\n[5003.12] Like she was sucking through a straw.\n[5004.88] Your mom was wow.\n[5007.12] You'd never get to the same.\n[5007.92] He's still going, dude.\n[5008.88] He's still going.\n[5014.00] Isn't that right, Carney?\n[5016.48] Okay.\n[5017.92] He hasn't let's see how long he goes.\n[5019.36] It's got to be what?\n[5020.40] Three minutes now at least.\n[5022.00] Uh that's a big reason why the companies are coming in.\n[5024.72] You know, one year depreciation, one year write-off, one year expensing.\n[5028.96] Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n[5030.48] So they're so they're coming in there.\n[5035.52] Uh to have a great country who can't have crime.\n[5039.36] And we don't have crime, but we have cities where there's tremendous crime.\n[5043.44] And Chicago's a lot of people.\n[5044.40] And you know what I think?\n[5045.12] I think Donald Trump feels he has license to do this because Joe Biden didn't answer questions, and he would hand out the questions pre- Okay, let's hear.\n[5052.08] He's done.\n[5052.72] A question, a question.\n[5054.48] A question for the president.\n[5056.00] You remain president.\n[5058.56] I'd like to know how come the UK and the European Union succeeded to sign deals and bring the tax down, and Canada still hasn't been able to do the same thing.\n[5067.76] Yeah, because they're not let you go next to each other.\n[5070.72] You know, it makes it uh in many cases it's much better and easier.\n[5076.16] If I may.\n[5078.00] You may not relate as it stands right now.\n[5080.80] We are the second largest trading partner of the United States.\n[5083.44] We do a lot of trade going across the border.\n[5085.84] We're uh we're cooperating, first thing.\n[5087.76] Secondly, we are the largest foreign investor in the United States.\n[5091.12] Half a trillion, Trump is going to usurp him at some point.\n[5094.08] Yes.\n[5095.36] Because of how the next five years if we get uh the agreement that we expect to get.\n[5100.24] Thirdly, there are areas as the president just to do.\n[5102.80] Well, expect in one hand.\n[5105.12] Maybe not so much conflict.\n[5106.16] We compete.\n[5106.96] There are areas where we compete, and it's in those areas where we have to come to uh an agreement that works.\n[5114.08] But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that's what we're focused on.\n[5118.48] And we're gonna get the right deal.\n[5119.84] Right deal for America, right deal, obviously for my perspective for Canada.\n[5125.76] Okay.\n[5126.80] Is it just me or is there a lot more gold in that office than there used to be?\n[5129.76] It is.\n[5130.40] He did, he put a lot more gold in there.\n[5132.72] Wait, wait, wait.\n[5133.68] So one thing where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome.\n[5138.08] That's the protective mechanism, and you see how that works.\n[5142.24] It's unbelievable.\n[5143.36] The uh you know, Ronald Reagan wanted to have it, and at that time they didn't have the technology, even close to the technology, but he was he was advanced uh and we'll be working together on a golden dome for the two countries, and uh it's something that I think is gonna be very important, especially when you look at the world, you look at what's happening.\n[5162.40] We want to have we want to have that protection.\n[5164.48] It's really amazing.\n[5165.92] The technology is unbelievable.\n[5172.48] Why do you say some federal workers should not get their back pay?\n[5175.68] Why do you say some?\n[5176.56] Well, you're gonna have to figure that out.\n[5177.92] Okay, ask ask the Democrats that question.\n[5182.64] Mr.\n[5182.88] President, just a follow-up there.\n[5184.32] I mean, the law says that when the government is reopens that workers will receive their their back paper.\n[5191.84] I follow the law, and I what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\n[5196.16] I always say will Canada be leaving empty-handed, or will Canada be leaving or will Mr.\n[5203.60] Carney be leaving Washington with a deal on terror.\n[5206.32] I think they're gonna be very happy.\n[5207.68] We have a lot of things that we're working on that uh people don't talk about.\n[5211.60] They talk about uh you know competitiveness.\n[5216.64] He's a very competitive person.\n[5218.88] And uh they talk about things that we don't necessarily agree on, but I think they're gonna walk away very happy.\n[5225.20] I think so.\n[5229.68] You see him take a sigh of relief, Carney's like minimum tariff that countries have got.\n[5235.92] When USMCA gets renegotiated, you want a minimum tariff on goods in Canada and the U.S.\n[5240.88] Well, we're gonna have tariffs in Canada.\n[5244.08] You know, they have them with us.\n[5245.68] Uh I will say with our farmers, as you know, they they went up to as much as 400 percent, 250, 300, and even one at 401.\n[5254.24] We found one having to do with a very small product, but it was it was high.\n[5258.40] So we've had so you know we've always had tariffs between the two.\n[5261.68] Shut up, loser.\n[5262.72] Actually, uh, Canada was charging us very high tariffs on our agricultural things, a lot of our agricultural product, and that's one of the things that we talk about for bringing that down.\n[5272.56] So, you know, this is a mutual thing, but uh we've been charged uh tariffs.\n[5276.64] Look, we're the king of being screwed by tariffs, just so you know.\n[5280.88] And I'm not talking about with Canada, I'm talking about with countries all over the world.\n[5284.56] When you look at Europe, when you look at China, when you look at uh all of the uh uh any almost every country charge the U.S.\n[5294.24] we didn't charge them because we were led by stupid people in many cases.\n[5298.72] Stupid people.\n[5299.44] They took advantage of our country.\n[5301.12] They're not taking advantage of us anymore.\n[5303.36] You know, if you looked at European Union, they're all my friends.\n[5306.32] I don't blame them.\n[5307.28] I blame our presidents.\n[5308.48] I b blame our past presidents and you know, business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of.\n[5310.24] Presidents and you know business leaders.\n[5313.20] But uh we are the the the uh king of countries that have been taken advantage of for many, many years.\n[5321.68] That's very true.\n[5322.24] I do really appreciate that he's drawn attention to the fact that the United States has, in the name of diplomacy, put our interests on the back burner.\n[5328.72] Yes.\n[5329.28] And he is less interested in going to cocktail parties, probably because he doesn't drink uh with these other world leaders than he is in getting a good deal for Americans.\n[5336.96] And the truth is, this is all it's it's it's all a mirage.\n[5339.76] If we want Canada, we could take Canada.\n[5341.76] But this idea of international governing bodies and globalism, it's like, oh, okay, well, it's better.\n[5346.08] Well, let's just let's just all hold hands and we are the world.\n[5349.04] Okay, great.\n[5349.76] But the truth is if we decided to use our leverage, Canada as part of the United States, the European Union really wouldn't be able to sustain themselves.\n[5356.88] And we're just saying, hey, all right, if you want to be our allies and actually be our allies.\n[5360.32] Otherwise, we can be entirely nationalistic and keep it within our borders, or if you want to take part, if you want to engage in trade, do it fairly.\n[5368.48] We've allowed ourselves to be fleeced.\n[5370.00] And real reason for that, if you just looked at the tariffs, for example, with Canada and dairy, it would render their dairy industry irrelevant.\n[5376.72] Yeah, exactly.\n[5377.68] I I think it's really interesting too.\n[5379.04] And I all the people who are anti-war and anti-what America maybe has done meddling-wise around the world over the last 50, 60, 70 years, they should love this, because essentially what he's doing is saying, you know, instead of using the CIA and that money to kind of influence these other countries over here, and instead of using our military to go to war in all these different places, I'm just gonna use our economy.\n[5397.04] Yeah.\n[5397.28] And I'm gonna I'm gonna end all the porn war stuff that I can.\n[5399.60] We're gonna go after cartels because they're hurting American citizens.\n[5402.16] We're gonna close our border, take care of American citizens, and we're gonna make sure that American businesses are not getting screwed and consumers not getting screwed by people overseas.\n[5408.96] Yeah, I'm like, I that that is much preferable to the wars that Dave Smith rails about, and also the CIA involvement in just about every corner of the globe.\n[5417.44] No, I agree.\n[5418.56] Let's grab a few chats and then I'm gonna go um throw up.\n[5421.44] Yes.\n[5422.08] They did uh if if you want it, they did send in that Carney clip.\n[5425.20] Oh, of him talking about let's let's see if it's reflected uh right here.\n[5428.16] So this is him now, but let's go back to then how Carney said he would deal with President Trump.\n[5433.28] President Trump.\n[5435.60] President Trump thinks Canada will cave in.\n[5440.08] We will never ever bow down to a bully.\n[5446.96] Unless it's our own king.\n[5450.16] Canadians Canadians will always stick together.\n[5455.60] Except Alberta.\n[5456.64] I would just love right now if you kissed the ring.\n[5458.32] What do you talk about from So c Mark?\n[5460.96] Do you still think I'm a bully?\n[5463.76] Yeah.\n[5464.24] Do you feel like you're caving in, Mark?\n[5466.56] Do you feel in control?\n[5469.04] This guy's a rube.\n[5470.64] All right, let's grab a couple of chats.\n[5472.32] All right.\n[5472.72] First chat from Newcastle, 777.\n[5475.68] Question for crew.\n[5476.80] Do you think the elevated expectations of some Americans have tarnished their view of Trump because he hasn't delivered on those excessively heightened expectations?\n[5484.56] Um I do think this.\n[5485.44] I think that a lot again of the of the Johnny come lately's because they haven't paid attention and they haven't thought of the world at all.\n[5492.96] What?\n[5493.60] Why did that's people like the Andrew Training?\n[5498.08] Patriotic answer.\n[5498.80] People like the Andrew Schultz, people like the Theo Vaughns, people like a lot of these shows.\n[5501.44] And to some degree, Joe Rogan, they haven't really thought of the world through the lens of, okay, what's right?\n[5505.92] What what is uh our history?\n[5507.60] What is patriotism?\n[5508.64] Where does America stand in the world?\n[5510.08] What makes us different?\n[5511.44] And they haven't paid attention to elections.\n[5513.44] I think this this is the first time they sort of toss their hat in the ring.\n[5516.64] And and it's kind of a teenager's point of view, where it's like, well, I didn't get every single thing that was on the on the wish list, so oh, uh undelivered promises.\n[5523.52] Whereas if you compare it to even Barack Obama to the left, if you compare it to George W.\n[5527.36] Bush to the right, if you compare it to Joe Biden to the left, like he's delivered in a way that no other modern president has.\n[5532.88] Yeah.\n[5533.28] So I think yeah, it's uh it's it's a little of that, but I also think that the people you're hearing from with these platforms are people who decided to kind of get in on a trend that was worth quite a few clicks during the election, and they don't really know how these things work.\n[5545.76] And that's not to let someone off the hook if they uh deliver nothing but empty promises, but I would say that that is l that is least descriptive of the Trump administration uh in comparison to any other administration in my recent memory.\n[5559.12] Aaron Powell It is funny to see some people, you know, uh give the criticisms of he doesn't promise on everything, uh, because Russia Ukraine is still happening and Israel Gaza is still happening.\n[5567.60] And it's like, yeah, uh that he did promise that within a hundred days or whatever it was.\n[5572.48] And we all kind of thought that was unrealistic if he had done it.\n[5575.76] Wow, what an amazing thing.\n[5577.12] But unrealistic expectations.\n[5579.28] It's still in his first year, and they're they're taking these these couple things and making it a big deal, which is funny to me because in their mind they're saying he is capable of it.\n[5590.08] Right.\n[5590.64] He could have done it, but he didn't do it.\n[5592.48] Right.\n[5592.96] Because you had to sit there in the same chair and admit that all these other conflicts have been solved.\n[5597.28] Yeah or cease-fired or or you know, whatever peace deals made.\n[5602.32] And again, what's the alternative?\n[5603.52] You of course would have continued uh uh Ukraine, Russia.\n[5606.64] I don't know about m Israel guy.\n[5608.48] It probably would have been the same thing, they just would have been delivering a little bit different rhetoric, and you would have a record number of illegal immigrants still pouring into this nation.\n[5615.84] You would still have uh, you know, Coca-Cola on snap, and you would still have USAID and you would still have NGOs and you would still have Antifa and you would still have mass illegal immigrants causing chaos in these sanctuary cities.\n[5627.76] So again, you have to compare it to the alternative and go, okay, are these results better?\n[5630.80] Yes.\n[5631.12] And then you have to compare the delivery on his promises in comparison to other administrations.\n[5635.76] I don't even think it's close.\n[5636.88] Would we have boots on the ground?\n[5637.84] If it was another administration, would we have boots on the ground in Ukraine?\n[5640.32] Right.\n[5640.80] Would be would be would we be sending money and weapons to either India or Pakistan?\n[5646.24] Right.\n[5646.64] Would we be involved in some kind of Cambodian conflict?\n[5649.92] Right.\n[5650.40] How many of these other conflicts would be be involved in?\n[5653.28] Israel would be they would we have boots in the ground there?\n[5656.08] Yeah.\n[5656.64] Yeah.\n[5656.96] And I can't think of any president who is more anti-people dying in foreign uh affairs than Donald Trump, honestly.\n[5662.56] You have to give him that.\n[5663.52] Whether he can wave a magic wand and end all conflicts, no one has ever been able to do that.\n[5667.04] But I think I've been uh I've I've been really pretty uh pretty happy with what we've gotten, and I I expect a lot more to come in the next three years.\n[5674.88] Next chat.\n[5675.60] All right, next chat from Luz Cannon.\n[5677.92] I'm pretty anti-government on most things.\n[5680.32] How would you square being anti-government but also supporting the feds with all the attacks from the left towards ICE and reporters slash MAGA?\n[5687.84] What do you mean supporting the feds?\n[5690.08] ICE.\n[5697.60] Let me read that again.\n[5698.40] You're saying being anti-government but supporting the feds with all you're saying I should support ICE?\n[5702.88] No, I think you're saying that.\n[5705.68] I think he's saying how do you how do you grapple with being anti-government and then uh being pro-ICE.\n[5710.32] Well, I think this is also this is kind of uh a misconception.\n[5713.28] Um conservatives, and this is the difference between us and libertarians, we are not anti-government.\n[5717.36] We are not anarchists.\n[5718.48] We believe in a in a legitimate purview of government that is limited.\n[5723.12] And I've said this going back to 2008, 2009, I've used the analogy of a hockey referee.\n[5728.40] And I use it just because, you know, okay, Canadian, but it's also the only sport where this is the case.\n[5731.84] Uh hockey referee, their job is to keep the pace, the flow of the game, make sure that the players are safe, meaning us as citizens.\n[5737.60] Uh, and outside of that, keep their whistle in their pocket.\n[5739.92] So national defense, safety, right, borders would fall under the legitimate purview of government.\n[5745.44] That's one of the few legitimate roles of government.\n[5747.76] A military, some kind of enforcement arm to make sure that the lawless don't basically exploit the lawful.\n[5754.72] And uh in that case, when you're dealing with sanctuary cities and having dealt with Antifa and these people and these left-wing radical groups, and I don't even mean radical in their viewpoint, I mean radical in their execution because they're they're simply mirroring the viewpoints of the mainstream left, they're just more violent than those who would, you know, get up on a dais.\n[5772.80] Uh they're also funded in a lot of ways.\n[5774.80] They're also funded by NGOs.\n[5776.00] They're also funded by a lot of government wings.\n[5777.84] So at that point, uh, what do you want?\n[5779.84] Do you want the lawless and the people who advocate for open borders?\n[5782.56] You want them to have uh them to enjoy an open season on people who are here to enforce the law so they protect you.\n[5788.48] I don't think there's anything that's uh inconsistent with conservatism and supporting ICE deporting people who shouldn't be here to begin with.\n[5796.96] They already broke the law, they have no business being here.\n[5799.28] That is a legitimate role of government to deport people who have no business being here.\n[5802.32] Exactly.\n[5802.64] I understand where they're coming from uh and uh the sentiment against you know federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and stuff like that.\n[5809.76] But the difference between them and ICE is that ICE is not targeting American citizens.\n[5813.60] Right.\n[5813.92] They are targeting people that are not supposed to be here and getting them out.\n[5816.56] That's a completely different purview from what the other three letter agencies are doing and the criticism that we give to them.\n[5822.08] Now, the left understands that completely, and that's why the left will go out and say a Maryland man or a father from Illinois or an innocent student from Georgia.\n[5831.12] Like they they'll try to pull at that heart.\n[5833.68] They're not they're not doing that for themselves and for their people on the left.\n[5836.24] They're doing that for us, they're doing that for you because they know that you have this um this distrust in your institutions in the three-letter agencies, and they think that's gonna bleed into the uh to the immigration sector because they're saying, oh, they're coming after Americans, or they're coming after innocent people, and that's not what they're doing.\n[5852.24] Yeah.\n[5852.56] So uh yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but it's a different different agency, different.\n[5856.24] Yeah, I also think about it.\n[5857.76] The IRS under Barack Obama was used to target conservative Americans simply, right?\n[5861.84] As a political tool.\n[5862.72] Let's target conservative Americans.\n[5863.92] Let's look at, for example, the FBI using the ADL, they were too busy investigating Charlie Kirk and turning point USA to deal with actual domestic terror groups.\n[5872.16] ICE is pretty clear in their purview in what they're supposed to deal with as far as immigration.\n[5875.76] But I also would like to see our other government wings like the FBI like the CIA actually return to whatever intended purpose they have.\n[5882.72] I do think it should be very limited.\n[5884.24] Um, but I think there's a very big difference between targeting American citizens of a political persuasion and targeting terrorists or illegal aliens.\n[5891.12] Next chat.\n[5891.84] All right, next chat from Damon Knight.\n[5894.40] Question for the crew if the left continues to ruin their reputationslash image, do you see the U.S.\n[5899.28] effectively becoming single party?\n[5900.96] Or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to\n[5900.40] Single party, or are there enough radical leftists to keep them on life support?\n[5903.84] No, it's gonna follow a cycle of whitewashing, and that's what I think you're starting to see with like I said, some of these Johnny come lately is they're gonna go back to, oh actually, yeah, but I don't really like Donald Trump and conservatives are dumb and redneck, you'll see that again, and they'll try and make it seem like the left is the party of intelligentsia, and they'll go back to you know the kind of George W.\n[5920.96] Bush mode of attack where oh they're stupid.\n[5922.96] So um it oscillates back and forth.\n[5925.20] I do think that the left has a problem, a demographic problem, which is good.\n[5928.72] Shoes on the other foot for the first time with Gen Z um, and and that swung really hard and really fast.\n[5934.96] I don't know how principled it is, so it remains to be seen.\n[5937.52] Uh, but uh yeah, I think I think it'll kind of go back and forth.\n[5940.64] I think the the left will kind of course correct and they'll present themselves as more moderate, which is what they've done in the past, too.\n[5945.92] That's my opinion.\n[5947.68] I agree next chat.\n[5949.04] All right, next chat from Remuglican Jake.\n[5951.84] Oh, nice.\n[5952.56] Yeah, nice.\n[5953.36] Uh with this with the increased BS from Portland creating an order for locals to not allow ICE to use city property.\n[5959.84] When do issues like the mayor meet legal distinction for insurrection, Josh?\n[5964.00] Thank you for your service.\n[5965.12] Now answer this about Chicago.\n[5967.12] Yeah.\n[5967.84] But Chicago was a great city.\n[5969.76] But this is real life.\n[5971.52] There's it's no family matters, there's no Earth.\n[5974.96] But even not even Stefan.\n[5978.00] He was very cool.\n[5978.80] Stefan took a pill, became really cool.\n[5981.60] Um I think that uh in some of these cases it does meet the criteria for insurrection.\n[5987.76] Yes.\n[5988.40] I mean, honestly, what people are trying to say January 6th was an insurrection.\n[5991.52] Okay, if you're gonna use that standard, how about an entire city?\n[5994.48] Uh why wasn't that used for CHOP?\n[5997.44] For Chess.\n[5998.64] That was the actual definition of an insurrection, not allowing local police force, let alone some kind of national guard to go in.\n[6005.12] Not allow and and basically subjecting citizens who did not elect these people in Chaz, CHOP, Seattle, to the rule of their self-created mob.\n[6016.08] Yeah, I think a lot of these would meet the criteria for it.\n[6018.64] I think so too.\n[6019.28] I and I think specifically there's a difference between not going in for Chopper Chaz if you do the the calculation and say, okay, we need to like we need to handle this a different way because if we go in now they have somebody to fight and it's gonna make the situation even worse, even though I probably would have said go in.\n[6032.72] When it's a city doing it, when it's a state doing it, no, I'm sorry.\n[6037.52] All bets are off, man.\n[6038.72] You don't get to do that.\n[6039.76] Right.\n[6040.00] And I am all for states' rights.\n[6041.60] States don't have the right to do this, though.\n[6043.68] No.\n[6044.16] They can't do that to the citizens of the United States.\n[6047.52] That's the reason that the government can say, listen, we have these rules federally again.\n[6052.32] You're the person earlier, you're you're not a anti-government, because anti-government, if you take that to the extreme, there is no government and somebody else just kind of steps up and rules and then it whatever it happens anyway, fiefdoms occur.\n[6063.68] You're anti-big government.\n[6065.04] This is not one of those things.\n[6066.16] This is one of those things that every American should say, listen, we can't have sanctuary cities.\n[6070.00] We can't do that.\n[6070.96] This is one of the government.\n[6072.32] Can't do it.\n[6072.72] And that's the problem too when you go so far like the libertarian right where people would say it's so far right that's that horseshoe effect.\n[6077.28] They don't believe in borders at all.\n[6078.64] A lot of libertarians.\n[6079.76] They can't defend they can't defend borders.\n[6082.08] If you're a libertarian, Dave Smith got caught flat-footed on this.\n[6084.88] You cannot defend having a border.\n[6086.72] Right.\n[6087.36] If you're truly a libertarian.\n[6088.80] And that's why you need to have some nationalism.\n[6090.24] Yeah.\n[6090.56] You need to have some nationalism.\n[6091.52] Hey, our nation is different.\n[6092.88] We we want our nation set apart from other nations.\n[6095.52] And how do we well the first step in doing that is making sure that we have borders where we know who is in our nation who subscribes to the beliefs of this nation.\n[6103.20] And that doesn't mean that we have to all follow lockstep, but yeah, no, we have a nation.\n[6107.20] We have borders.\n[6108.32] You have that everywhere else in a functioning society.\n[6111.36] You have borders in your house by having a house.\n[6114.48] You have borders with cities, you have borders with states, you have borders you used to have borders with countries.\n[6118.48] In this case, the only exception should be the wealthiest country in the world who's cre by the way, created the wealthiest country in the world where more people want to come than anywhere else on planet Earth, and we're not supposed to protect it.\n[6130.08] The only reason we wouldn't protect it is because we're being brow beaten into it by some other international governing body because they want to get in on that action.\n[6137.28] No.\n[6137.92] We created this shining city on a hill, and it's our job to protect it and certainly to preserve it for the American citizens who helped build it into what it is.\n[6145.52] Yeah.\n[6146.00] That's it's it's that simple.\n[6147.60] Final chat, because I'm gonna go purge.\n[6150.24] All right, final chat from DP Coast.\n[6152.88] Why is Trump all in on AI dev when he knows a vast majority of Americans will lose their jobs?\n[6158.16] Isn't that counterproductive?\n[6159.52] Stephen and crew be safe and God bless.\n[6161.68] I I don't know this one.\n[6162.96] This might not be the best uh chat, but but uh but I have my issues with that.\n[6166.00] I have a quick answer for it because it listen, I I understand that a lot of Americans will lose their job through tech technological shifts that have occurred historically.\n[6174.56] It's it's happened before in very similar ways.\n[6177.68] Obviously, AI seems to be one of those ways that could like drastically change versus some of the other ways that maybe like all right, horse and bugged at cars.\n[6184.48] That changes things a little bit, right?\n[6186.08] Um tellers and you know, uh instead of ATMs.\n[6189.12] I get it.\n[6189.60] There's a lot of stuff that is going to change the market if we don't try to lead in this market or at least as much as we possibly can, somebody else will.\n[6198.64] So the the outcome will not be changed by our participation or not.\n[6203.12] It's a good point.\n[6203.68] It is a bit inevitable.\n[6209.60] Because everybody's gonna try.\n[6211.36] Look at the money that's being spent right now in AI development and the engineers and the best in bright.\n[6216.48] It is insane.\n[6217.76] We've never seen anything like this before.\n[6219.92] And I go go to any of the other technological advancements, nothing is like this.\n[6224.40] Well, and I think that I think it needs to be married with some very, very strong regulations.\n[6228.32] And again, this goes to being a conservative, not a libertarian.\n[6231.20] Um technology, uh, what's its purpose?\n[6235.12] Its purpose is to better the lives of yeah, to serve us, the citizens of this country.\n[6240.24] Yeah.\n[6240.56] And so the regulations should exist to enhance the power uh of a tool like this that could, it could either greatly enhance the quality of life for a lot of Americans, or it could be incredibly detriment detrimental.\n[6252.00] I don't know, I'm not an AI expert.\n[6253.28] I know that people have been saying that there's going to be the AI apocalypse for many, many years now.\n[6256.56] At some point.\n[6257.36] Um I think it needs to be married with very strong regulations.\n[6260.48] Uh if we're talking about being the leaders, you know, of the world, because China won't care.\n[6264.32] And if we're the leaders, we can set those kinds of regulations globally, whereas China will never care about it.\n[6269.04] They'll just do whatever they have to do.\n[6270.56] Yeah.\n[6270.96] Um that being said, I I always hear this about AI, and AI can help with a lot of things, but uh AI is often, in my experience, more often wrong than not when I ask it a question.\n[6281.68] And that's often because of the programming, right?\n[6283.60] It's only as good as its input.\n[6284.88] And right now, I mean, you you can go and ask Grock something, and you're like, well, that's a verifiably wrong answer.\n[6288.72] Right, yeah.\n[6289.36] So people have been saying this for a long time.\n[6291.28] We're not quite there yet.\n[6292.32] I agree with Gerald.\n[6293.20] We do, we don't want to be left behind.\n[6295.04] But I also think that if we want to be the leaders of this, if we want to be spearheading this, then we need to definitely think we need to we need to recenter our focus and go, okay.\n[6304.08] Everything that comes in that we're looking at as far as some form of economic development or technological development.\n[6309.28] How does this benefit the citizens of this country?\n[6312.32] How does this benefit this country?\n[6313.84] The only country left where people are actually free, and I know that that could that can be up for debate.\n[6319.20] Okay.\n[6319.60] But it's the freest country on earth, certainly compared to Europe.\n[6322.40] How does it benefit us?\n[6323.92] How does it improve our lives and the regulations should be married to it accordingly?\n[6329.36] I don't think I and I do think when people say there's been rampant capitalism that's left uh unfettered, there have been problems with that.\n[6335.60] The solution is not socialism.\n[6338.08] The solution is to go, okay, how does this serve the best interests of the American people?\n[6342.24] And I also think individually, we need to marry these improvements and we need to marry these freedoms with our duties and responsibilities.\n[6348.80] Because I think something that's really kind of kind of kind of presented um kind of a lot of problems as people going, hey, I'm free, okay, great.\n[6357.04] But a free society can really only work for a just and moral people.\n[6361.36] We know that from the founding fathers.\n[6362.88] And I think considering the godlessness, the godlessness, not only that we have now, but how how touched we are by the godlessness of the world in comparison through social media and being able to communicate with anyone in the world at any given time.\n[6376.48] We need to recenter ourselves a little bit and go, okay, who what is it?\n[6380.96] What is it that we're looking to achieve and who are we as a nation?\n[6385.36] And that'll determine how we chart a course for it.\n[6387.60] I don't have all of the answers on AI because frankly I don't understand it, and it's usually wrong, and it just pisses me off.\n[6391.84] So I do things old school.\n[6393.28] But we do need to marry our freedom here with responsibilities and with duties.\n[6399.60] And as far as culturally, I hope to see a little bit more of that messaging coming forward, because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of people who have an extra couple of Lambos and servants going, hey, I made it, go get yours, and that doesn't benefit anyone.\n[6411.28] I don't know if any of that made sense, but I have a fever right now.\n[6413.12] I'm gonna go purge.\n[6413.92] Bye.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.
