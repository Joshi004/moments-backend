it's now happened twice since then.\n[393.12] I've never had this in my life.\n[394.56] Sorry.\n[395.04] Hopefully it's not the old stomach big C.\n[397.68] I keep poisoning you, so I can't.\n[399.04] Oh, well, that makes show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you uh before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudis?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.72] No uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good?\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah, glad you're back.\n[429.92] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.84] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good, you know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.36] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds, and uh we have a black and white in the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised that I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just he can only be one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.64] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No.\n[475.84] I know I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.04] They also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's the thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fits like ah okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers.\n[524.24] You should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 4'10, and he looks like he is so mad that he is 4'10 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.24] Yes, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.00] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of in of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.48] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.32] Is it?\n[616.72] Okay.\n[617.04] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You should laugh at them.\n[621.44] We heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.24] Okay.\n[624.48] How to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.60] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.28] Well, yeah, you're you go for compensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.56] I'm from York, York.\n[656.72] Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.72] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell?\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxville?\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.52] Uh but here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.16] Every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.40] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.56] Um, she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way.\n[699.12] Because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because they everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no.\n[709.20] Your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.84] If you want to get other people to laugh at Steven Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.12] AOC.\n[726.16] And people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[737.92] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think, whatever it is, a Snapchat live, Instagram.\n[742.72] I have no idea what what it was.\n[744.08] Was it TikTok?\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.68] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller.\n[748.00] Uh 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average.\n[751.12] On CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.52] You are profiling brown people.\n[760.16] That that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.20] That is the it's such a oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks.\n[776.56] They're taking jobs away from whites.\n[778.56] They're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.72] That's not exactly a no, Steven.\n[782.56] Can can you just unimperfectly state that he dumbs?\n[787.20] When I said it was a dumb question, it meant no.\n[789.20] Why I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.68] So my full answer is no.\n[797.52] That is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller.\n[803.92] He's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.64] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah, this is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.32] Were you about to say something, noodles?\n[820.08] I'm not the model of height, but your short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.84] Yeah, wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[827.92] No.\n[828.24] We didn't we didn't uh hurt.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.64] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No.\n[475.84] I know I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.04] They also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's the thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fits like ah okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers.\n[524.24] You should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 4'10, and he looks like he is so mad that he is 4'10 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.24] Yes, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.00] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of in of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.48] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.32] Is it?\n[616.72] Okay.\n[617.04] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You should laugh at them.\n[621.44] We heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.24] Okay.\n[624.48] How to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.60] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.28] Well, yeah, you're you go for compensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.56] I'm from York, York.\n[656.72] Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.72] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell?\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxville?\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.52] Uh but here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.16] Every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.40] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.56] Um, she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way.\n[699.12] Because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because they everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no.\n[709.20] Your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.84] If you want to get other people to laugh at Steven Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.12] AOC.\n[726.16] And people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[737.92] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think, whatever it is, a Snapchat live, Instagram.\n[742.72] I have no idea what what it was.\n[744.08] Was it TikTok?\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.68] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller.\n[748.00] Uh 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average.\n[751.12] On CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.52] You are profiling brown people.\n[760.16] That that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.20] That is the it's such a oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks.\n[776.56] They're taking jobs away from whites.\n[778.56] They're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.72] That's not exactly a no, Steven.\n[782.56] Can can you just unimperfectly state that he dumbs?\n[787.20] When I said it was a dumb question, it meant no.\n[789.20] Why I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.68] So my full answer is no.\n[797.52] That is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller.\n[803.92] He's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.64] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah, this is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.32] Were you about to say something, noodles?\n[820.08] I'm not the model of height, but your short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.84] Yeah, wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[827.92] No.\n[828.24] We didn't we didn't uh hurt.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.40] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.56] Um, she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way.\n[699.12] Because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because they everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no.\n[709.20] Your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.84] If you want to get other people to laugh at Steven Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.12] AOC.\n[726.16] And people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[737.92] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think, whatever it is, a Snapchat live, Instagram.\n[742.72] I have no idea what what it was.\n[744.08] Was it TikTok?\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.68] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller.\n[748.00] Uh 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average.\n[751.12] On CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.52] You are profiling brown people.\n[760.16] That that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of

They're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.72] That's not exactly a no, Steven.\n[782.56] Can can you just unimperfectly state that he dumbs?\n[787.20] When I said it was a dumb question, it meant no.\n[789.20] Why I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.68] So my full answer is no.\n[797.52] That is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller.\n[803.92] He's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.64] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah, this is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.32] Were you about to say something, noodles?\n[820.08] I'm not the model of height, but your short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.84]

white in the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised that I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just he can only be one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.64] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No.\n[475.84] I know I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.04] They also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's the thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fits like ah okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers.\n[524.24] You should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 4'10, and he looks like he is so mad that he is 4'10 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.24] Yes, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.00] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of in of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.48] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.32] Is it?\n[616.72] Okay.\n[617.04] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You should laugh at them.\n[621.44] We heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.24] Okay.\n[624.48] How to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.60] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.28] Well, yeah, you're you go for compensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.56] I'm from York, York.\n[656.72] Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.72] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell?\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxville?\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.52] Uh but here's the

Oh, well, that makes show so weird.\n[401.20] That'd be easier.\n[402.96] But uh uh we do uh have a lot to get to, and you guys were giggling while I was doing the uh the cold open.\n[407.68] I don't know why.\n[408.16] Let me ask you uh before we how much would how much would it cost you to sell out to the Saudis?\n[413.52] Uh of course I'm speaking of the Saudi Arabians, but I said it I used shorthand I don't know if there's some I don't know if there's some other Saudis out there who are don't lump us in with them.\n[424.72] No uh so uh Captain Morgan, CEO.\n[427.76] Good?\n[428.08] Yeah, I'm doing well.\n[428.88] Yeah, glad you're back.\n[429.92] Yeah.\n[430.16] Yeah.\n[430.48] People weren't thrilled with you, uh filling in the old.\n[433.84] Yeah, yeah.\n[434.48] I should make it feel good, you know.\n[435.84] Well, we've been on the road a lot lately too.\n[437.36] That's the thing, is when you're on the road and you're doing change my minds, and uh we have a black and white in the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised that I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just he can only be one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.64] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No.\n[475.84] I know I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.04] They also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's the thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fits like ah okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers.\n[524.24] You should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 4'10, and he looks like he is so mad that he is 4'10 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.24] Yes, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.00] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of in of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.48] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.32] Is it?\n[616.72] Okay.\n[617.04] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You should laugh at them.\n[621.44] We heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.24] Okay.\n[624.48] How to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.60] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.28] Well, yeah, you're you go for compensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.56] I'm from York, York.\n[656.72] Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.72] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell?\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxville?\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.52] Uh but here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.16] Every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.40] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.56] Um, she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way.\n[699.12] Because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because they everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no.\n[709.20] Your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.84] If you want to get other people to laugh at Steven Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.12] AOC.\n[726.16] And people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[737.92] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think, whatever it is, a Snapchat live, Instagram.\n[742.72] I have no idea what what it was.\n[744.08] Was it TikTok?\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.68] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller.\n[748.00] Uh 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average.\n[751.12] On CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.52] You are profiling brown people.\n[760.16] That that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.20] That is the it's such a oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks.\n[776.56] They're taking jobs away from whites.\n[778.56] They're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.72] That's not exactly a no, Steven.\n[782.56] Can can you just unimperfectly state that he dumbs?\n[787.20] When I said it was a dumb question, it meant no.\n[789.20] Why I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.68] So my full answer is no.\n[797.52] That is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller.\n[803.92] He's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.64] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah, this is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.32] Were you about to say something, noodles?\n[820.08] I'm not the model of height, but your short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.84] Yeah, wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[827.92] No.\n[828.24] We didn't we didn't uh hurt.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

bookie.\n[468.64] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No.\n[475.84] I know I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.04] They also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's the thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fits like ah okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers.\n[524.24] You should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 4'10, and he looks like he is so mad that he is 4'10 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.24] Yes, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.00] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of in of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.48] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.32] Is it?\n[616.72] Okay.\n[617.04] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You should laugh at them.\n[621.44] We heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.24] Okay.\n[624.48] How to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.60] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.28] Well, yeah, you're you go for compensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.56] I'm from York, York.\n[656.72] Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.72] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell?\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxville?\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.52] Uh but here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.16] Every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.40] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.56] Um, she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way.\n[699.12] Because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because they everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no.\n[709.20] Your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.84] If you want to get other people to laugh at Steven Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.12] AOC.\n[726.16] And people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[737.92] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think, whatever it is, a Snapchat live, Instagram.\n[742.72] I have no idea what what it was.\n[744.08] Was it TikTok?\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.68] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller.\n[748.00] Uh 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average.\n[751.12] On CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.52] You are profiling brown people.\n[760.16] That that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.20] That is the it's such a oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks.\n[776.56] They're taking jobs away from whites.\n[778.56] They're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.72] That's not exactly a no, Steven.\n[782.56] Can can you just unimperfectly state that he dumbs?\n[787.20] When I said it was a dumb question, it meant no.\n[789.20] Why I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.68] So my full answer is no.\n[797.52] That is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller.\n[803.92] He's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.64] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah, this is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do that.\n[817.12] The left will not do that.\n[818.32] Were you about to say something, noodles?\n[820.08] I'm not the model of height, but your short doesn't really work.\n[823.20] Yeah.\n[823.84] Yeah, wait.\n[825.52] It doesn't really work.\n[827.92] No.\n[828.24] We didn't we didn't uh hurt.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array.

here's the thing.\n[696.00] She won't be able to make fun of anyone in an effective way.\n[699.12] Because she will not, and this is the left today, by and large.\n[702.88] She won't engage anywhere adversarial.\n[704.80] So she's like, make fun of them, expose them for just, you know, because they everyone else will laugh at them.\n[708.80] No, no.\n[709.20] Your own followers may laugh at them because they're as dumb as you.\n[711.84] If you want to get other people to laugh at Steven Miller, you would have to chip chip chip chip chip away at his ideas.\n[717.52] To do that, you would have to engage people like Stephen Miller in a form where you could actually express your own.\n[723.60] She won't do that.\n[725.12] AOC.\n[726.16] And people like even the people you respect, like Bernie, like Warren, they don't appear.\n[730.80] The left does not appear on adversarial programming.\n[733.36] It's not something that they do because their ideas do not hold up to scrutiny.\n[737.92] Let's contrast AOC doing a, I think, whatever it is, a Snapchat live, Instagram.\n[742.72] I have no idea what what it was.\n[744.08] Was it TikTok?\n[744.80] Facebook Live, maybe.\n[745.68] Yeah.\n[746.08] Doing that versus Miller.\n[748.00] Uh 5'10.\n[749.20] Uh again, one inch above average.\n[751.12] On CNN yesterday with people who obviously are adversarial, and just look and see how he handled them something that AOC could never do.\n[757.52] You are profiling brown people.\n[760.16] That that this immigration crackdown is designed to go after people of color.\n[767.20] That is the it's such a oh, what a dumb question.\n[771.28] The real aliens who are here are taking jobs away from blacks.\n[776.56] They're taking jobs away from whites.\n[778.56] They're taking jobs away from Latinos.\n[780.72] That's not exactly a no, Steven.\n[782.56] Can can you just unimperfectly state that he dumbs?\n[787.20] When I said it was a dumb question, it meant no.\n[789.20] Why I just want to be clear and precise.\n[791.04] I appreciate you trying to qualify my questions, but nevertheless, I think it's a fair one that a lot of people have.\n[795.68] So my full answer is no.\n[797.52] That is a lie, and it's a dumb question.\n[800.72] I like that Stephen Miller.\n[803.92] He's got a bit of he's got like a tick.\n[806.64] Dumb question.\n[807.44] I can't believe.\n[808.48] Just just say, hey, hey, CNN, have you considered saying he's short?\n[813.20] Thanks for the hot tip.\n[814.48] But it's not.\n[815.12] Yeah, this is a lie.\n[816.40] They won't do

they're willing to show up in Saudi Arabia where women weren't allowed to drive until a few years ago, and gays get thrown off of rooftops for uh, you know, a couple of decent checks.\n[257.44]

white in the gray issues coming up where I'm still surprised that I didn't get assaulted, but uh stolen though.\n[446.80] Yeah, it's just he can only be one place at one time until you know AI overtakes us all.\n[451.28] And Friday, Saturday, Saturday, November 28th, 29th at Bricktown Comedy Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n[456.48] Uh he's not underscore Firestein on X.\n[458.64] Josh Feierstein, how are you?\n[459.92] I'm good.\n[460.48] And for me, it would take 34,400.\n[463.12] 34,400.\n[464.48] Yeah, that's how much I owe my bookie.\n[466.08] Good.\n[467.20] So he's a good bookie.\n[468.64] He's giving me time.\n[469.68] I still have nine toes.\n[470.96] But the problem is if you if you went, do they allow betting in Saudi Arabia?\n[474.24] Probably not.\n[474.72] I don't think so.\n[475.36] I don't know.\n[475.68] No.\n[475.84] I know I don't think they don't they don't allow drinking.\n[478.16] Maybe that's Qatar.\n[479.04] They also do allow drinking.\n[480.40] You just have to do it privately and be rich.\n[482.16] No, you were thinking of sodomy.\n[483.36] They don't know sodomy.\n[484.64] Saudi sodomy Arabia.\n[486.00] And of course they do allow sodomy.\n[487.76] Sodomy my labia.\n[488.96] Yeah.\n[489.44] That's the other country.\n[490.32] It's not gay if you just don't tell anybody.\n[495.36] Speaking of, you know, you know who should tell nobody anything ever.\n[498.40] AOC.\n[499.60] Um, and here's the thing.\n[500.72] I know that there are plenty of people on the left who are are formidable opponents who can be incredibly articulate and they can uh voice an opinion that sometimes will you know give us give us fits like ah okay, that's a pretty good point.\n[510.56] Uh AOC is none of those things.\n[512.96] You sure so she she has a solution here because the left is a losing.\n[516.72] They kind of see the writing on the wall, they know where the momentum is going, and so her solution is uh, at least to her followers.\n[524.24] You should uh call conservatives like short and ugly and stuff.\n[530.08] Laugh at them.\n[531.28] Stephen Miller is a clown.\n[533.68] I've never seen that guy in real life, but he looks like he's like 410.\n[539.68] And he looks like he is angry about the fact that he's 4'10, and he looks like he is so mad that he is 4'10 that he's taking that anger out at any other population possible.\n[556.32] Pause.\n[556.80] Like she is one of those people who I can watch in real time talk herself into a corner and have no idea how to talk herself out of it.\n[564.24] He is aiming it at any other population or such nature.\n[569.52] Like she is an idiot.\n[570.96] She's a very, very dumb person.\n[572.88] And I don't just say it because I disagree with her politics.\n[575.20] She's dumb.\n[576.08] Watch her talk herself into a corner, being cornered by a bunch of midget liberals right here.\n[580.24] Yes, no kidding.\n[581.12] Here it comes.\n[581.76] Little people coming after her.\n[584.56] So you you make it come by.\n[586.88] Laugh at them.\n[588.16] Laugh at them.\n[589.12] Yes, the resistance to authoritarianism is very real.\n[592.00] The risks of abuse of power are very real.\n[594.32] But one of the most powerful cultural things that you can do to a political movement that is predicated on the puffery.\n[602.00] It's fake being handcuffed.\n[603.36] Of in of insecure, insecure masculinity.\n[607.28] That's what this is about.\n[608.48] This isn't people talking about toxic masculinity.\n[610.72] More than it's like, let's put that to the side for just one second.\n[614.24] This is about insecure masculinity.\n[616.32] Is it?\n[616.72] Okay.\n[617.04] And one of the best ways that you can dismantle.\n[620.56] You should laugh at them.\n[621.44] We heard it.\n[622.00] Of insecure men is by making fun of them.\n[624.24] Okay.\n[624.48] How to make fun of anyone's anything.\n[628.32] Wait.\n[628.80] But the way people overcompensate over their own stories is what I'm talking about there.\n[635.60] So thank you for the clarification.\n[637.28] Well, yeah, you're you go for compensate from for your story.\n[640.00] You're not even from the Bronx.\n[641.04] You're from a wealthy area in Connecticut with a median household income like 174,000.\n[645.28] You don't sound like you're a sister of one of the the sharks.\n[649.76] And I don't sound like I'm from the Bronx because I'm not.\n[653.36] Because I'm not.\n[654.24] Yeah.\n[654.56] I'm from York, York.\n[656.72] Westchester.\n[657.36] Where is she from?\n[658.72] Is she from Yorktown?\n[659.76] Bronxfell?\n[660.56] Is she from Bronxville?\n[662.24] I don't know, but like the best thing is to make fun of them.\n[664.40] And I but I'm not making fun of them.\n[666.88] But you didn't you just say make fun of people?\n[668.56] Yorktown heights.\n[669.44] Yorktown Heights.\n[670.24] There you go.\n[671.04] So first off, uh Miller is listed as 5'10.\n[673.92] Oh.\n[674.32] AOC is 5'4.\n[676.16] Just so he's slightly above average.\n[678.24] She's slightly below average as far as the average heights out there.\n[681.52] Uh but here's the thing.\n[682.96] And not that that really matters, you know, because she's the one who says you should just make fun of people.\n[686.56] No, I I look, I'm not gonna lie to you.\n[688.16] Every now and then I like engaging a little ad hominem.\n[690.40] Uh yeah.\n[691.12] I think you do.\n[691.84] Yeah, I do.\n[693.04] I'm I'm pretty open about it.\n[694.56] Um, she is an idiot.\n[695.44] And
